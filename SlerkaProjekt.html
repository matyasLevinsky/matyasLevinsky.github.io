<h1>Analyzing the CNN coverage of the Prague University shooting</h1>
<p>Given that the University shooting that happened on the 21 December 2023 was unprecedented in Czech history, I wondered whether it would be reflected as such in american media that has grown increasingly desensitized to news of mass shootings.</p>
<section id="resources-used" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="resources-used">Resources used</h4>
<p>I used the web-scraping tutorial provided by renatatopinkova and the book <em>Text Mining with R</em> by Julia Silge and David Robinson. ChatGPT-4 and its internal module R-Guru were used for troubleshooting.</p>
</section>
<section id="getting-the-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="getting-the-data">Getting the data</h2>
<p>I wanted to compare the mass shooting to comparable reporting about mass shootings using the same live-block format CNN used for the Prague shooting. I used the first 12 articles that popped up for the Google search <em>‘site:cnn.com “mass shooting” live-news’</em> and filtering for articles in 2023-2024.</p>
<p>I created a list of the necessary URLs and a couple of helper functions: <code>readUrlList</code>, <code>parseUrlList</code> and <code>generateTeiCorpus</code>. They are simple for-loops that do what their name suggest. Let’s load them together with the packages we will need.</p>

Scroll through these posts for the latest updates., A gunman is dead after killing at least 14 people and wounding many others in a shooting rampage Thursday at a central Prague university, according to Czech police. The attack at Charles University came after authorities received some prior warning about a student at the school, according to the country's head of police, though an investigation into key details of the shooting is just beginning. Here's what we know so far: The attack had a devastating toll: At least 14 people were killed and 25 others wounded, according to the latest update provided by police. Authorities revised the number of those killed and hurt in the attack as their investigation unfolded and victims received treatment at hospitals. At least 10 of those wounded are in serious condition, officials said. The victims were gunned down at Charles University, located in the busy tourist center of Prague.\nThe shooter is dead: Early reports indicate the shooter took his own life after the attack, but that is not yet confirmed, Czech Police President Martin Vondrášek said in a news conference. The shooter has not been formally identified because of the severity of his injuries, the police chief said, but investigators believe they know his identity. The suspect is a 24-year-old philosophy student at the school who had a gun permit and several weapons, Vondrášek said.\nPolice were tipped off about the suspect: Authorities received a tip saying the suspect was traveling from his hometown of Hostouň to Prague intending to take his own life, police said. Shortly after that, they learned that a man believed to be the suspect's father was found dead in Hostouň, which is about 100 miles from the Czech capital.\nOfficials had evacuated a different school building: Police were aware the suspected shooter had a lecture at 2 p.m. CET (8 a.m. ET) Thursday and had evacuated the building where the lecture was meant to take place, Vondrášek said. But then police received a call about a shooting in a different building on campus, according to the police chief.\nStudents scrambled to escape the gunfire: Police said it took time to help students safely evacuate after the shooting, as some had locked themselves in classrooms. A group of students climbed out of a classroom window and hid on the ledge of the university's Faculty of Arts building in an attempt to escape, a photo on social media showed.\nOfficials expressed shock at the violence: Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala expressed his condolences to the loved ones of the victims and said there was "absolutely no explanation, no justification" for the "senseless attack." He said it was believed to be an isolated incident and not an act of terror or attack by an organized group. Other European leaders also condemned the violence and expressed shock at the attack., The Czech Republic will observe a day of mourning Saturday for those killed in the Prague shooting, officials announced at a joint news conference Thursday. During the day of mourning, flags will be flown at half-staff and a minute of silence will be held nationwide. Bells across the country will toll for the victims of the attack, according to Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala., Graduate student Jakob Weizman, 25, told CNN he was in a classroom with his professor when they heard what sounded like gunshots and screams — and then the sounds grew louder.&nbsp; "My professor tried to lock the door, but it would not work," Weizman said. Luckily, Weizman managed to finally get the door locked, he said. Moments later, they started pushing classroom furniture up to the door to create a barricade. "About five minutes after that, someone tried to open the door very violently," Weizman said. He believes it may have been the shooter, but he does not know for sure. Weizman, who told CNN he lived in the United States for 15 years, never thought he would experience a mass shooting event in Europe.  "You think it will never happen," he said. "I'm still processing a lot." The graduate student said the police eventually arrived, so he broke down the barricade to let them in. Weizman said he could see blood on each floor as police escorted him down., Czech police chief Martin Vondrášek updated the number of people killed in a shooting at Charles University in central Prague, saying the 14 died and 25 others were injured.&nbsp; Vondrášek had previously said that at least 15 people had died. He said that of the 25 injured, 10 were in a serious condition. The police chief updated the numbers while speaking at a press conference on Thursday evening., Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala expressed his condolences to the loved ones of the victims killed in a shooting at Charles University in Prague on Thursday. Addressing the nation, he said many young lives were lost in the “senseless attack." The prime minister said officials believe it was an isolated incident and was not an act of terror or an attack by an organized group. He also assured people that there is no longer any danger.&nbsp; “Dear citizens, please let us think of all those who have lost their loved ones. This Christmas will be unimaginably sad for them. Let us share their sorrow and their pain. At this dark hour, we should come together and respect each other, to show our respect for the victims,” Fiala said., All events have been canceled at Charles University in Prague on Thursday and Friday as tighter security measures go into effect following a deadly shooting on its campus. At least 15 people were killed and dozens of others were wounded, according to Czech police. The university said it is also offering psychological help to those who need it.&nbsp; “We mourn the loss of life of members of our university community, express our deepest condolences to all the bereaved and our thoughts are with all those affected by the tragedy,” the university said., European leaders are condemning violence and expressing their shock after a shooter killed 15 people at a university in Prague on Thursday, saying they are sending condolences to those killed and injured. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni reiterated condemnation of "all forms of violence, fanaticism and terrorism," according to a post on X, formerly Twitter. Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen said in a post he is "deeply shocked by the cruel attack" in Prague and his thoughts are with those in the Czech Republic. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said his country "stands with the people of the Czech Republic&nbsp;during these difficult times," adding he was "appalled by the shooting" and offered thoughts to the families of those killed. French President Emmanuel Macron expressed the "strong emotion" he felt when he learned that the shooting took place at Charles University., The man suspected of killing at least 15 people at Charles University in Prague had a gun permit and owned several weapons, according to Czech Police President Martin Vondrášek. Police previously said they have not formally identified the deceased shooter due to the severity of their injuries, but that they are suspected to be a 24-year-old student at the school. About gun regulations in the Czech Republic: The country has relatively liberal gun laws compared to the rest of the European Union. To obtain a gun legally, a person needs an official firearm license, which requires a medical examination, a weapon proficiency exam and no previous criminal record.&nbsp;\u2028 According to official police statistics, more than 300,000 people have legal permit to own a gun. As of 2022, almost 1 million legally owned weapons were officially registered in the Czech Republic., Authorities received tips about a 24-year-old philosophy student at Charles University who they suspect was responsible for the deadly mass shooting at the campus in central Prague Thursday, Czech Police President Martin Vondrášek said in a news conference.

Law enforcement sources said a search of the suspect's last known address was conducted by FBI SWAT teams Thursday.\nRobert Card, 40, is facing an arrest warrant for eight counts of murder and should be considered armed and dangerous, police said. He is a certified firearms instructor and a member of the US Army Reserves, according to law enforcement.\nPolice are urging residents to shelter in place and report any suspicious activity to authorities. Lewiston is the state's second-largest city and is located about 36 miles north of Portland.\nThe rampage in Maine is the deadliest US mass shooting since&nbsp;the Uvalde school massacre. It adds to a grim docket of 565 such incidents, where four or more people are shot excluding the shooter, across the country this year, according to the&nbsp;Gun Violence Archive., Our live coverage of the hunt for the suspect in the Maine mass shooting has moved here, A shooting rampage in Lewiston, Maine, left 18 dead and 13 more injured Wednesday evening after a gunman opened fire on a bowling alley and a restaurant.  Lewiston is a sprawling residential and industrial area just off the Maine Turnpike and is home to two hospitals and the private liberal arts school Bates College. It’s a largely working-class community, with a median household income of about $48,000 and in which about 16% of the population lives in poverty, according to the&nbsp;US Census. Maine Gov. Janet Mills governor, who met her husband in Lewiston, described it as a “special place.” President Joe Biden has spoken by phone with Maine lawmakers and “offered full federal support in the wake of this horrific attack,” the White House said in a statement. Lewiston Mayor&nbsp;Carl Sheline is “heartbroken for our city and our people,” he said. “Lewiston is known for our strength and grit and we will need both in the days to come.” Lewiston Auburn Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce President Shanna Cox on Thursday called the scene of both attacks “family locations.” “It was family league activity at the bowling alley. The likeliness of this having direct impact for so many here is so real.” Auburn Mayor Jason Levesque lost friends in the shooting, he told “CNN This Morning.” A teenager who went to school with his son was shot and is expected to recover, he said. “There’s going to be very few people in this community that have not been touched by this,” he said. “It’s going to be with me for the rest of my life, and it’s really hard for me to explain that.” “The other folks that I knew that were there either as witnesses or family members of witnesses; it’s obviously traumatic,” Levesque said. “The bright spot was seeing individuals reunified with their loved ones after not knowing for so long, but on the on the other side, the ones that were waiting and waiting, probably would never be reunified.”, Peyton Brewer-Ross, 39, was participating in a cornhole tournament at Schemengees Bar and Grille when he was killed during Wednesday’s mass shooting in Lewiston, his brother Ralph Brewer told CNN.&nbsp; Brewer-Ross loved playing cornhole and enjoying hanging out with friends at Schemengees, his brother said. “It’s just surreal and sad. Now my brother is not here anymore along with 17 other people,” Brewer told CNN in a phone interview on Thursday. “He just went to play cornhole. He is the nicest person you would ever meet. He never had a bad thing to say about anyone.” Brewer-Ross “loved being a dad more than anything else,” his brother said. Two weeks ago, Brewer-Ross celebrated his daughter Elle's second birthday.&nbsp; In the past five years, Brewer-Ross worked his way through the iron pipefitter apprenticeship program and graduated last year. When he wasn’t spending time with his family, he enjoyed comics, cornhole, playing games and having fun with friends, his brother said.&nbsp; “We are walking around in a daze not knowing what to say, what to do, or how to act, because of a senseless shooting,” Brewer said. “It’s so unbelievable that this can continue to happen over and over again and nothing changes.”, The town of Lisbon, Maine, is asking residents to continue to shelter in place throughout the overnight hours as officials continue to search for the suspect in Wednesday night's deadly mass shooting. All Lisbon schools and town-owned buildings will be closed tomorrow, the update noted.&nbsp; Lisbon is about eight miles southeast of Lewiston, where the shooting rampage unfolded on Wednesday evening., Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) SWAT teams on Thursday conducted a search of the last known address associated with Robert Card, the suspect in a Wednesday night shooting rampage that left 18 people dead in Lewiston, law enforcement sources told CNN. The&nbsp;sources&nbsp;told CNN that&nbsp;once FBI SWAT&nbsp;teams cleared the house, investigators came in to execute the&nbsp;search&nbsp;warrant, looking for items like computers, notes, weapons and any evidence that&nbsp;might indicate a plan to carry out the&nbsp;shootings. Card, 40, is facing an arrest warrant for eight counts of murder and should be considered armed and dangerous, police said. State and local investigators did a similar style entry and search at another location, as well as a search of Card's car on Thursday, the sources told CNN. Law enforcement officials returned to the Lewiston shooting suspect's last known address on Thursday evening, according to CNN teams on site. At least five law enforcement vehicles, including an armored vehicle, were seen at the scene, CNN reported. A spokesperson with the Maine Department of Public Safety told CNN law enforcement is "not positive Robert Card is in this house," adding officials are "simply doing our due diligence." In Lisbon, investigators recovered a gun on Thursday while searching an abandoned car at a boat launch connected to the suspect, but it hasn’t been determined whether the firearm was used in Wednesday’s shooting rampage, a law enforcement source told CNN., Tommy Conrad, 34, was identified as one of the victims of the Lewiston, Maine, mass shootings, his family confirmed to CNN affiliate WMTW.  Conrad was the manager at the bowling alley, one of the two locations of last night's shooting rampage. He is survived by his nine-year-old daughter., Residents of Auburn should stay vigilant as the search for shooting suspect Robert Card continues, Mayor Jason Levesque said on Thursday.  “We are Mainers, stay vigilant, practice good situational awareness,” Levesque said. He said that the community is still in shock following the deadly shootings that took place in the neighboring town of Lewiston. The mayor highlighted the authorities and medics response to the shootings on Wednesday. “They all came in on-duty, off-duty,” Levesque said, “They rushed to the scene.”, Law enforcement officials returned to the Lewiston shooting suspect's last known address on Thursday evening, according to CNN teams on the scene. A spokesperson with the Maine Department of Public Safety, Shannon Moss, told CNN law enforcement is "not positive Robert Card is in this house," adding officials are "simply doing our due diligence."

The search was based on Card's association with the address in Bowdoin, Maine, the law enforcement sources said.  The&nbsp;sources&nbsp;told CNN that&nbsp;once FBI SWAT&nbsp;teams cleared the house, investigators came in to execute the&nbsp;search&nbsp;warrant, looking for items like computers, notes, weapons and any evidence that&nbsp;might indicate a plan to carry out the&nbsp;shootings. CNN heard loud bangs near that address on Thursday, including someone shouting "FBI" through a bullhorn.  State and local investigators did a similar style entry and search at another location, as well as a search of Card's car on Thursday, the sources said. Similar searches of additional locations are expected in the coming days, the sources said., Multiple school districts and colleges in southern Maine announced they will be closed Friday as the search continues for the suspect in two shootings that left 18 people dead and 13 injured in Lewiston.

Auburn and Brunswick Schools said they plan to resume classes on Monday but with a two-hour delay to the start of the school day. Central Maine Community College also shared on Facebook that it would remain closed on Friday., Maine Sen. Susan Collins called the day a mass shooting killed at least 18 people and injured 13 others in Lewiston a "dark day" for her state.  Speaking at a news conference with other state lawmakers on Thursday, Collins said the “heinous attack” is the worst mass shooting to happen in Maine. An extensive manhunt is underway for the suspect in the shooting. Various law enforcement officials are searching for Robert Card, 40, who is wanted for eight counts of murder, police said. At least 80 agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation are looking for Card, Collins said, in addition to personnel from various other agencies, including the ATF and the Coast Guard. “Everyone is determined to bring the killer to justice," she said. Speaking to the family of the victims, the Maine senator acknowledged that “no words can fully ease the shock, the pain and the justifiable anger that you are feeling.” Still, she said she hopes that they find strength in the support of people from around the country.  Watch:, Comedians John&nbsp;Mulaney&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pete Davidson&nbsp;have postponed two upcoming comedy shows in Maine following Wednesday’s&nbsp;mass shooting.

An&nbsp;intensive manhunt is still underway&nbsp;for suspect Robert Card, 40, who&nbsp;faces an arrest warrant&nbsp;for eight counts of murder. In remarks on the shooting Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre urged Congress to pass legislation to address the epidemic of gun violence.   She also cited a slew of executive orders President Joe Biden has signed as president to address gun violence, but acknowledged, “the president has been clear that executive action alone is just not enough.” Looking forward, Jean-Pierre said Biden “will continue to do everything in his power to protect the American people to protect our communities to protect our children, and we urge— we urge congressional Republicans to come to the table to come to the table if there truly is common ground at this time.” Jean-Pierre declined to say if Biden plans to visit Lewiston, Maine. She said it is a "dynamic situation on the ground" and that the administration's priority is "to make sure that Maine and local enforcement has the resources that it needs." She said Greg Jackson, the deputy director of the White House office of Gun Violence Prevention, convened federal agencies Thursday morning “to discuss federal resources already deployed and ensure readiness to meet any additional community needs as the people of Lewiston work through the unimaginable grief that they may be experiencing.”, Maine officials released a timeline of events surrounding Wednesday's deadly shooting rampage at two locations in Lewiston, Maine, which did not include police response time to the incidents. “That information will come out in an after-action review,” Maine Department of Public Safety Public Information Officer Shannon Moss explained, adding that law enforcement is focused on apprehending the suspect and an “after action review” was conducted after most “critical events.” Here's the timeline provided by the Maine Department of Public Safety: At 6:56 p.m., Wednesday, October 25, 2023: Auburn Communications Center was notified that a man walked into the Just-In-Time Recreation bowling alley on Mollison Street in Lewiston and began shooting.

Robert Card, 40, is being sought as a suspect, and police said he should be considered armed and dangerous. The attack appears to be the deadliest mass shooting of 2023, adding to a grim docket of 565 such incidents reported this year across the United States, with four or more shot excluding the shooter, according to the&nbsp;Gun Violence Archive. See photos below from the scene:, Tricia Asselin, 53, worked part-time at Just-In-Time Recreation in Lewiston, but was there bowling on Wednesday night when a gunman came in and opened fire, her brother told CNN Thursday. His other sister was also at the bowling alley but she was able to escape, he said. Johnson spoke to CNN while on a flight to Maine to identify his sister and be with the rest of their family. He called Asselin his “baby sister” and said they were very close. He said her adult son is devastated by the loss. Asselin “was the rock of the family” and “kept everyone on an even keel," Johnson said. “If there was an argument going on, she would be the one to calm everyone down. If somebody was having a bad day, she would be right on the phone to talk to you about it,” he said., A patient that was transferred from Central Maine Medical Center (CMMC) to Maine Medical Center (MMC) after Wednesday’s shooting rampage has been discharged, a statement from MaineHealth said. “On Oct. 25, Central Maine Medical Center (CMMC) transferred one patient injured in the Lewiston shootings to Maine Medical Center (MMC).

She said the administration will continue to provide support to local authorities as the investigation into the shootings uncovers what happened. An&nbsp;intensive manhunt is still underway&nbsp;for suspect Robert Card, 40, who&nbsp;faces an arrest warrant&nbsp;for eight counts of murder. Police said Card should be considered armed and dangerous, urging residents to shelter in place and report any suspicious activity to authorities. Harris noted that, in the United States,&nbsp;firearm deaths are the leading cause of death for children, warning, “Gun violence has terrorized and traumatized so many of our communities in this country.”&nbsp; Firearms accounted for nearly 19% of childhood deaths (ages 1-18) in 2021,&nbsp;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder database. “And let us be clear, it does not have to be this way — as our friends in Australia have demonstrated,” Harris added. Australia has long been referenced in the ongoing debate over how to stop mass shootings in the US. It passed nationwide gun control in 2006 after a lone gunman in Tasmania killed 20 people with his first 29 bullets, all in the span of 90 seconds. In a written statement later Thursday, Harris&nbsp;cited the newly-formed White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention as a way the Biden administration "will continue to work to save lives" until legislation is passed., On Friday, Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, was scheduled to host inauguration celebrations for its new president, Garry W.

Police are still searching for the suspect, Robert Card, 40, who is facing an arrest warrant for eight counts of murder, Maine State Police Col. William Ross said during a Thursday news conference. The suspect's brother, Ryan Card, said in a text message to CNN that the family has "helped law enforcement in anyway possible" and that they are urging Robert to turn himself in. He would not tell CNN if his brother has responded to the family’s requests.&nbsp; "The police have been given anything that we can offer to facilitate their efforts," he said, adding that “there are many people hurting out there, please focus on them … this is many people’s worst nightmare.”, The suspect in the Maine mass shooting is a skilled marksman and outdoorsman who was among the best shooters in his Army Reserve unit, a former colleague in the unit told CNN.&nbsp; Robert Card, who police are searching for in connection with the fatal shooting of at least 18 people in Lewiston, Maine, previously reported mental health issues and hearing voices and threatened to shoot up a National Guard base in the state, Maine law enforcement officials said.&nbsp;&nbsp; The officials also said Card was reported to have been committed to a mental health facility for two weeks over the summer.&nbsp; Card’s sister-in-law, Katie O’Neill, said in a brief conversation with CNN Thursday that Card does not have a long history of mental health struggles.&nbsp; “This is something that was an acute episode. This is not who he is,” O’Neill said. “He is not someone who has had mental health issues for his lifetime or anything like that.”&nbsp;&nbsp; The 40-year-old Card is a petroleum supply specialist in the Army Reserve and first enlisted in 2002, according to records provided by the Army on Thursday. He has no combat deployments, according to the records.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clifford Steeves of Massachusetts told CNN he knew Card when they served in the Army Reserve together, starting in the early 2000s until about a decade ago. He said he never witnessed any concerning behavior from Card.&nbsp; “He was a very nice guy — very quiet. He never overused his authority or was mean or rude to other soldiers,” Steeves said. “It’s really upsetting.”&nbsp; Steeves said the two served together around the country at different points, including in Wisconsin, Georgia and New York. He said he felt as though he “grew up” with Card because they entered the Army as young men and trained together.&nbsp;&nbsp; Steeves said that while “aggressive leadership was very prominent” in the Army, Card stuck out for being a “rational, understanding person” who “led through respect rather than fear.”&nbsp; Steeves said Card never saw combat but had extensive training, including firearms training and land navigation, “so he would be very comfortable in the woods.” He described Card as an “outdoors type of guy” and a skilled marksman who was one of the best shooters in his unit.&nbsp; Another former Army Reserve member who served with Card also described him as a “nice guy” who “never had an issue with anybody.” The servicemember, who asked to speak anonymously due to the sensitivity of the situation, did not recall Card showing any kind of violent behavior., GOP Sen.

Collins added that Maine is "very grateful" for the help from the federal government, and noted that Tom Perez, a senior adviser to Biden and former Democratic National Committee chair, has been in constant contact with her.

The help included "approximately 100 team members" who were off-duty but came in to the hospital to help care for patients arriving from the scene of the shootings, Dr. John Alexander, the chief medical officer at Central Maine Medical Center, said in a news conference Thursday. The off-duty workers also helped treat people who were already in the hospital when it faced a sudden uptick in demand for trauma care. Nurses and physicians from other area hospitals joined the emergency response, along with ambulance services from other counties, Alexander said. At one point, Central Maine Medical Center had as many as 10 ambulance crews standing by outside the hospital's trauma center to ensure it could transfer any patients needed, according to Alexander. Nearby Boston and Dartmouth medical centers contributed extra helicopter services. "We were able to organize those resources and use them effectively," Alexander said of the sudden flood of support. CNN had reported Wednesday night that Central Maine Medical Center was calling in any available off-duty staff, according to Lewiston City Councilor Robert McCarthy., Two of Maine’s leading&nbsp;banks have shut down branches around Lewiston while a third has moved to shut down all branches throughout the state, as the manhunt for a mass shooter continues.

We will continue to be there every step of the way," he added. Noting that "countless" Americans have survived gun violence, he said it is "not normal, and we cannot accept it," adding that actions taken so far on gun safety are "simply not enough." "I urge Republican lawmakers in Congress to fulfill their duty to protect the American people. Work with us to pass a bill banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, to enact universal background checks, to require safe storage of guns, and end immunity from liability for gun manufacturers. This is the very least we owe every American who will now bear the scars — physical and mental — of this latest attack," Biden said., Robert Card, the suspect in Wednesday's shooting rampage, is facing eight counts of murder, Maine State Police Col.

The nonprofit and CNN define mass shootings as those in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter. Nearly 1 in 5 US adults have had a family member killed by a gun, including homicides and suicides, according to a 2023 survey from KFF (formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation). About the same proportion of adults have been personally threatened with a gun, and about 1 in 6 adults has witnessed an injury from a shooting, the survey found. More background: The FBI defines “mass murder” as the murder of four or more people and tracks “active shooter incidents,” but there is no federal or agreed-upon definition for a mass shooting. For all its data background, the Gun Violence Archive’s work is, at its heart, basic journalism. Researchers scrape data automatically from about 7,500 law enforcement agencies, media outlets and more organizations, the executive director Mark Bryant told CNN in 2022. They then comb through the results, double-check media sources, follow up with police, and add that information to the database. Most shootings are added to the system within about 72 hours, Bryant said. CNN's Annette Choi, Eric Levenson and Curt Merrill contributed reporting to this report., Residents of Bowdoin, Maine, were advised not to go outside early Thursday as the search continues for a person of interest in a deadly mass shooting in nearby Lewiston.

shooting at a private Christian elementary school in Nashville, Tennessee, police said.\nTwo of the victims were school employees. One was the head of the school and the other a custodian, according to the school. \nThe shooter, a 28-year-old Nashville resident police say was once a student at the school, was killed during gunfire with police, authorities said. \nThe attack, which police said was a targeted one and&nbsp;involved prior planning, was the deadliest US school shooting in nearly a year. The shooter had drawn detailed maps of the school, police said, including the entry points to the building. Police have also located&nbsp;writings from the shooter that they are reviewing., Our live coverage of the Nashville school shooting has moved here., Park Cities Presbyterian Church in Dallas&nbsp;released a statement Monday confirming that their former pastor, Chad Scruggs, lost his daughter Hallie in Monday’s shooting at the Covenant School. CNN had reported that Hallie Scruggs was among the three 9-year-old students shot and killed in the shooting.  Here is the church's statement:, In messages shared with CNN affiliate WTVF, a former middle school basketball teammate of Audrey Hale provides chilling new details regarding an exchange she had on social media with the shooter prior to yesterday's school shooting in Nashville.&nbsp; Averianna Patton said she saw a message on her phone that Hale had sent to her on Instagram Monday morning that stated Hale was planning to die by suicide and that she would see it on the news.&nbsp;A screenshot of a message published by WTVF appeared to show that the message was sent at 9:57 a.m. local time. "One day this will make more sense," Hale wrote. "I've left behind more than enough evidence behind. But something bad is about to happen," the message stated.&nbsp; "I tried to comfort and encourage her and subsequently reached out to the Suicide Prevention Help Line after being instructed to by my father at 10:08 am," Patton said.&nbsp; Patton tells WTVF that she she called the Nashville Davidson County Sheriff's Office at 10:13 a.m. to make them aware of the situation and was instructed to call Nashville's non-emergency number.&nbsp; "I called Nashville's non-emergency line at 10:14 a.m. and was on hold for nearly seven minutes before speaking with someone who said that they would send an officer to my home. An officer did not come to my home until 3:29 p.m.," Patton said. Don Aaron, spokesperson for the Metro Nashville Police Department, said during a news conference that the first calls of an active shooting came in at around 10:15 a.m. local time. When officers arrived, they went through the first level of the building, he said. They then heard gunshots coming from the second level of the building, according to Aaron. He said that's where police confronted and killed the shooter at 10:27 a.m. local time., Police in Nashville are still digging into the background and motivations of a former student who entered a Christian elementary school armed with AR-style weapons and detailed maps and opened fire,&nbsp;killing three children and three adults. If you are just reading in, here's the latest on the shooting and investigation:  The shooter: The person was identified as 28-year-old Audrey Hale. Hale was shot and killed by police during the Monday attack, and left behind “drawn out” maps of the Covenant School detailing “how this was all going to take place,” Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake said. As police work to piece together what led up to the violence, officials said they had determined where the shooter lived in the Nashville area and have interviewed Hale’s father.&nbsp; Hale, who attended the Christian school years ago, left writings that pertain to the shooting and had scouted a second possible attack location in Nashville, “but because of a threat assessment by the suspect – there’s too much security – they decided not to,” police chief said.The writings revealed that the attack at Covenant School “was calculated and planned,” Metro Nashville said. So far, little is known about the shooter. Hale graduated from Nossi College of Art &amp; Design in Nashville last year, the president of the school confirmed to CNN, and a LinkedIn profile says Hale worked as a freelance graphic designer and a part-time grocery shopper. Police have referred to Hale as the “female shooter” and at an evening press conference added that Hale was transgender. When asked for clarification, a spokesperson told CNN Hale used “male pronouns” on a social media profile. The weapons: The shooter was “someone that had multiple rounds of ammunition, prepared for confrontation with law enforcement, prepared to do more harm than was actually done,” the police chief said in a news conference. Three weapons – an AR-style rifle, an AR-style pistol and a handgun – were found and police believe Hale obtained at least two of the weapons legally, Drake said. A search warrant executed at Hale’s home also resulted in the seizure of a sawed-off shotgun, a second shotgun and other evidence, according to police. The victims: All three students shot and killed were 9 years old. They were identified as Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney. Three adults killed in the shooting were identified as 61-year-old Cynthia Peak, 60-year-old Katherine Koonce and 61-year-old Mike Hill, police said. Two Covenant School employees are among the victims of Monday’s mass shooting, according to the school. What is expected to happen today: Investigators were expected to spend Tuesday processing the scene and gathering more details about what happened during the roughly 14 minutes of terror at the elementary school. Mass shootings in America: The attack marked the 19th shooting at a school or university so far in 2023 in which at least one person was wounded, according to a CNN tally. With six victims, the shooting at Covenant is the deadliest school shooting since the attack in Uvalde, Texas, last May left 21 people dead. Read more about the shooting here., Kris Brown, the president of Brady: United Against Gun Violence, said the solutions to stopping mass shootings "are before us and they have been for a long time" but it will take voters to make the change.  Brady is a US nonprofit that advocates for gun control and against gun violence.  "It takes all of us. This isn't just on the kids. This is on adults," Brown added. "This is on their grandparents. This is on us and we can make a difference, but we have to make it an absolute priority and then hold elected officials to&nbsp;account when they do not vote 'yes' on bills to advance lifesaving measures.", A more heartrending and quintessentially&nbsp;American scene&nbsp;is hard to imagine. A human chain of children, hand-in-hand, shepherded by police officers, fled the latest school struck by unfathomable tragedy. On Monday, it was&nbsp;Nashville’s turn&nbsp;to join the roster of cities made notorious by a mass shooting epidemic much of the country seems prepared to tacitly accept as the price of the right to own high-powered firearms.&nbsp; The reality of what unfolded inside was inhuman, but it can unfortunately be imagined given the gruesome insider accounts that emerged from previous school shootings — in&nbsp;Uvalde, Texas,&nbsp;last year, or at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut in 2012. Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney, all 9 years old, were gunned down by a shooter armed with two AR-style weapons and a handgun, two of which police said were bought legally. Their names — known only to the rest of America in death — were released by police about the same time as they should have been going home from Covenant School for the day. Three staff, all half a century older, also died. They were Cynthia Peak, 61, Katherine Koonce, 60, and Mike Hill, 61. They were all murdered in the place that should be the safest: where kids go to school. But a plague of recent classroom rampages, distinguished even among America’s gun violence by their depravity, shows that nowhere is really secure.

Her other son, Aldane Brooks, was placed on lockdown at a nearby high school on Monday when the shooting occurred at&nbsp;Covenant School. “We didn’t know if we were safe,” Aldane Brooks told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “We didn’t know if someone was coming to kill us or not.” Brooks added that she wanted to race to her son's school the moment she heard news of a shooting, but he told her to wait as they had no information as to what was going on. “We’re not safe anywhere,” Brooks said, “We’re not safe in schools, we’re not safe when we go out to eat, we’re not safe in church, we’re not safe at the Waffle House.” Brooks said she thinks about mass shootings every time she drops her son off at school. The mother and son addressed families of the victims of Monday’s shooting saying they “understand this feeling first hand.” “The pain will forever be there, but you’re not alone,” Aldane Brooks said., In a&nbsp;tweet, Metro Nashville Police shared a photo of the car driven by Covenant School shooter Audrey Hale as well as the doors that the shooter shot out to gain entry into the school. Inside the vehicle, additional material written by the shooter was found, the tweet said. “Active shooter Audrey Elizabeth Hale, 28, drove this Honda Fit to the Covenant Church/school campus this morning and parked.

Ashbey Beasley told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday evening that she was visiting her sister-in-law in Nashville and was set to have lunch with a friend when she heard about the shooting. Following the Highland Park shooting, Beasley has joined a gun violence prevention group and dedicated her life to making a change with gun laws. “It’s the access to guns that is killing us,” Beasley said, “We’re not going to see any change until our lawmakers step up and pass gun safety legislation,” “Unfortunately that’s where we’re at, we have to take care of each other, survivors have to take care of each other,” Beasley said. Beasley&nbsp;jumped in a news conference&nbsp;earlier Monday, following the Nashville shooting, to protest against gun violence. Former president Barack Obama&nbsp;took to Twitter&nbsp;to share the video of Beasley during that news conference saying, “We are failing our children. Guns are now the leading cause of death for children in the U.S. Michelle and I mourn with the students and families of the Covenant School today.”, The shooter who killed six people at Covenant School in Nashville Monday may have resented having to attend the school in the past, according to Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake.

Still, Jean-Pierre said Biden would continue to call on Congress to take action, adding Biden “has done almost as much as he can from the federal level to show how important this is to him.”, The&nbsp;Nashville Fire Department&nbsp;tried to provide life-saving efforts during&nbsp;Monday's shooting incident at&nbsp;Covenant School, Covenant Presbyterian Church, authorities said Monday during a news&nbsp;conference.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our&nbsp;crews&nbsp;were&nbsp;able&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;scene&nbsp;to&nbsp;pull&nbsp;out&nbsp;those&nbsp;that&nbsp;had&nbsp;viable&nbsp;signs&nbsp;of&nbsp;life.&nbsp;Those that&nbsp;were&nbsp;still&nbsp;showing&nbsp;the&nbsp;option&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;saved," Nashville Fire Department's&nbsp;Kendra Loney said.&nbsp;&nbsp; A reunification site was set up soon after with "mental&nbsp;health&nbsp;specialists&nbsp;and&nbsp;professionals" for the families and students,&nbsp;Loney added.&nbsp;&nbsp; On a typical day, there's about 200&nbsp;students&nbsp;and about 40 to 50 staff members inside the school,&nbsp;Don Aaron with the&nbsp;Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said.

Hammond, CNN, A shooting that killed a local DJ and injured more than 20 others, including children, at the end of the&nbsp;Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl victory rally on Wednesday appears to have stemmed from a dispute between several people, according to the city's police chief. \nAuthorities say two juveniles remain in custody while police investigate the violence that overshadowed the celebration. A third person, an adult, was released Thursday after officials deemed them uninvolved in the shooting.\nAbout a million fans were in downtown Kansas City for the parade, and players were still on the stage of the victory rally when the shooting took place.\nThe shooting was at least the 48th mass shooting in the United States this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.  We've wrapped up our live coverage for the evening. You can learn more about the investigation by scrolling through the posts in this feed., Police are investigating a shooting that killed one person and wounded more than 20 others on Wednesday. The shooting happened after a rally celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl win. Here's what we know so far: Victims: The woman killed has been identified as Lisa Lopez-Galvan, a local DJ and a mom of two kids, according to her family and police. More than 20 others were hurt, ranging from 8 to 47 years old, according to Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves. Half of those people were under the age of 16, she added. A majority of the patients admitted to University Health Truman Medical Center and Children's Mercy Kansas City have been discharged, hospital officials.\nWhat happened: The shooting was a personal dispute between "several people" in which others were wounded, Graves said. She said there was no link to terrorism or homegrown extremism.\nNo one charged: Initially, police detained three people for further investigation — one adult and two juveniles, according to Graves. The adult was released Thursday afternoon after police determined they were not involved, a spokesperson for the police department said. Two juveniles still in custody have not yet been charged, but police are working with juvenile prosecutors to "review investigative findings," officials added.\nOngoing investigation: Bullets and shell casings left behind at the scene of the shooting are key pieces of evidence being analyzed to determine a possible connection to the people in police custody as well as any other possible suspects, a law enforcement source told CNN. Police said they recovered an unspecified number of guns. ATF investigators will also look at whether the bullets or shell casings match any of those firearms or any weapons in databases, according to the source.\nWitness accounts: One man said he overheard an altercation before the shooting where a woman told a presumed shooter, "Don’t do it, not here; this is stupid." He said the person pulled out a gun and "started shooting and spinning in a circle," Jacob Gooch, Sr. told CBS' Gayle King. Kansas&nbsp;City Chiefs offensive lineman Trey Smith told ABC he found shelter in a closet and guided others to safety. He also helped calm scared kids, as did cornerback L'Jarius Sneed., One of the three people detained in the wake of Wednesday’s Super Bowl celebration shooting has been released, the Kansas City Police Department said. That person was determined not to have been involved, a police spokesperson tells CNN.&nbsp; Only two juvenile teens are currently in custody in connection with the incident, according to the police department. "A third person who was in custody was determined to not be involved," spokesperson Alayna Gonzalez said. "The two juveniles are currently being held in custody while we work with juvenile prosecutors to review investigative findings and determine applicable charges," the spokesperson added. "The juvenile court system determines the custody status of all juvenile arrests.", Kansas City Chiefs cornerback L'Jarius Sneed said the shooting after Super Bowl celebrations on Wednesday brought back memories of being a target of gun violence. Sneed said he and others rushed into a building when the chaos started. The four-year NFL pro said kids "surrounded me" while seeking shelter in a basement.&nbsp; "I tried to comfort them in that situation. Just tell them everything is OK. Just rubbing their back(s) and just be like, 'Everything’s going to be fine,'" he said. "It's very sad," he told ESPN. "Just for the kids. They are trying to celebrate something, a big accomplishment for us. We were just trying to celebrate it with them, and for that to happen is very tragic.", A majority of the patients admitted to University Health Truman Medical Center and Children's Mercy Kansas City have been discharged, hospital officials confirmed Thursday afternoon.&nbsp; At University Health Truman Medical Center, eight of the 12 patients have been released. Of the four still being treated, three suffered gunshot wounds and one sustained a broken bone while trying to flee the scene, according to doctors. Two of the gunshot victims are in critical condition in the hospital’s intensive care unit, Dr. Dustin Neel said. He called one a “young gentleman” and the other an “older woman,” and said they were the first two patients the hospital received.&nbsp; Children’s Mercy Kansas City said they initially admitted 12 people after the shooting — 11 children and one adult. Nine of the children had gunshot wounds. All but three patients have been discharged as of Thursday, hospital officials said. Those three still in the hospital are children, Chief Nursing Officer Stephanie Meyer said. She said they have been stabilized and all are doing well and expected to make full recoveries., Radio traffic between law enforcement and other emergency responders details the response to Wednesday’s shooting at the&nbsp;Chiefs&nbsp;victory rally at Union Station in Kansas City. In the Broadcastify&nbsp;channel Kansas City Metro Area Fire, EMS, and Police, authorities can be heard working to get medical personnel to wounded victims and coordinate the search for suspects. “Fire’s getting reports of shots fired at (unintelligible) and Main … there’s a bunch of people running, can we get more people down here?" one person said. On the radio, responders are heard reporting a shooting on the west side of Union Station and dispatching emergency medics. Later, officers take one person into custody and start to try to clear the crowd out., President Joe Biden is devastated but “also frustrated”&nbsp;by Wednesday’s mass shooting in Kansas City that killed one person and injured more than 20 others, the White House said Thursday. In a statement lamenting the shooting Wednesday, Biden mourned that the celebration “turned to tragedy,” before calling on Congress to pass an assault weapons ban, limit high-capacity magazines and strengthen background checks. The press secretary wouldn’t say if Biden plans to speak to the victims or travel to Kansas City., The family of the woman killed in a shooting after a Super Bowl celebration for the Kansas City Chiefs is remembering her as an amazing mother, wife and daughter. Radio&nbsp;DJ Lisa Lopez-Galvan&nbsp;died after getting shot&nbsp;at&nbsp;the rally, her family and her employer KKFI 90.1 FM have said, and police confirmed her death on Thursday.  "We are heartbroken with the loss of our loved one, Elizabeth 'Lisa,'" her family said in a statement, adding that she leaves behind her husband and two kids. CNN's Chris Boyette contributed reporting to this post., Bullets and shell casings left behind at the scene of Wednesday's shooting after the Chiefs Super Bowl rally in Kansas City, Missouri, are key pieces of evidence being analyzed to determine a possible connection to individuals currently in custody — as well as any possible additional suspects — a law enforcement source told CNN.&nbsp; Specialists from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) are also analyzing bullets recovered at the scene and in victims to determine which gun was responsible for killing or injuring specific people, the source said.&nbsp; Ejected casings are additionally being studied to identify whether unique markings left behind on a shell casing by a gun during firing — similar to a fingerprint — match other shootings in law enforcement databases, the source said.&nbsp; On Wednesday, Kansas City police said three people had been detained, and an unspecified number of guns were recovered by police. In addition to helping tie those guns to rounds fired at the scene, the source said ATF investigators are working to determine whether any bullets and shell casings recovered fail to fit the unique profile of those recovered weapons, which could indicate additional suspects are at large., Half of the over 20 people injured in the shooting at the end of the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl victory rally are under the age of 16, Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said. The victims range in age from 8 to 47 years old, according to Graves. The one person who has died from the shooting was 43 years old, she confirmed. CNN&nbsp;previously reported that Lisa Lopez-Galvan, a&nbsp;Kansas&nbsp;City-area radio DJ, died during the shooting and was identified by KKFI radio 90.1 FM.  There were 22 victims of the shooting who were treated at the scene and transported by emergency personnel, said Kansas City Interim Fire Chief Ross Grundyson on Thursday. Of those taken to hospitals, there were eight critical patients in critical condition, seven in serious condition and six with minor injuries. He said all the critical patients were transported off the scene within 10 minutes of first responders’ arrival. The number treated and transported by first responders may not include everyone who was injured, as some victims may have sought treatment on their own after fleeing the scene., Free counseling services are now available to anyone in the Kansas City community after a shooting after the Chiefs Super Bowl parade on Wednesday, according to the Jackson County prosecutor's office. Counselors and social workers will be available at the United Church of Christ in Brookside from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. local time on Thursday, according to the office, and the services are free. The Child Protection Center will also have resources there, it said. Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas also said people can call "988" to be connected with services. Victim advocacy information will also be available soon, he said at a news conference Thursday., When asked if Kansas City would hold another parade for any future championships by the Chiefs, Mayor Quinton Lucas said Thursday that the city is not done hosting parades. "We have a plan for a St. Patrick’s Day parade in Kansas City. We have parades all the time. I don’t think they’ll end," he said. "Certainly we recognize the public safety challenges at issue that relate to them." "We’ve had parades like this before," he said. "We had one last year without this type of incident. We had a Kansas City Royals parade where we had almost no arrests in 2015. So I don’t think in anyway that this is Kansas City. I do think there is a gun violence challenge in this community and many others.", Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said the investigation into the deadly shooting following the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl victory rally remains ongoing and the department has yet to charge the individuals involved in the incident.  “We have not charged them yet; this is still under investigation,” Graves said at a news conference Thursday.  Two of the detained are juveniles, according to the police chief.  A law enforcement official told CNN the three people in custody are all believed to have been involved in a personal dispute and that, initially, 10 people were questioned.

Throughout the day, officials were being called to various locations for what police described as apparently legitimate sightings of the suspect. An undercover officer saw and confronted the gunman, then backup was called, police said.

He was a former Coast Guardsman and was discharged from active duty in January of this year. Patterson had minimal contact with the police department before the shooting., Deion Patterson, the Midtown Atlanta shooting suspect, was captured inside a gated condominium complex in Cobb County on Wednesday night, about 11 miles north of the shooting scene, local residents told CNN. Christy Colwell, who lives at Waterford Place, said dogs barking within the complex made her concerned the fugitive might be hiding in the pool area, which includes a gazebo.

Sen. Jon Ossoff released a statement Wednesday decrying gun violence.  "The level of gun violence in America today is unconscionable and unacceptable, and policy makers at all levels have a responsibility to ensure public safety and implement long-overdue reforms," the Democratic senator said    Gov.

Dickens, speaking at a news conference to announce the arrest of a suspect in the shooting, called for universal background checks, better red-flag laws to allow judges to remove guns from people who pose risks – and more action to make sure "those who shouldn't have guns don't have them." The mayor thanked Grady Memorial Hospital and the authorities involved in the investigation and offered prayers to the victims and their families., Authorities late Wednesday described the chaotic manhunt that led to the apprehension of Deion Patterson, the suspect in the mass shooting at an Atlanta medical facility.  Patterson was arrested in Cobb County, near the Truist Park baseball stadium. He commandeered a pickup truck near the scene of the shooting, according to police. And the plate of the truck was detected by a license plate reader in Cobb County, which is northwest of downtown Atlanta, they said. VanHoozer said officials were being called to various locations throughout Cobb County for what he described as apparently legitimate sightings of Patterson, as he was still at large.

Powell, Maureen Chowdhury and Elise Hammond, CNN, Louisville police have released bodycam footage showing the tense police confrontation with the gunman who shot multiple people at a bank on Monday, leaving at least five dead.\nThe&nbsp;mass shooter, who was killed by police, legally bought an AR-15-style rifle at a local gun dealership, the interim Louisville Metro Police chief said.\nIt’s still not clear what provoked the 25-year-old employee&nbsp;to go on a deadly rampage at Old National Bank and livestream the gruesome attack.\nThe AR-15 and its offshoots have been used in several recent mass shootings,&nbsp;including the Nashville shooting just two weeks ago. Editor's note:&nbsp;This story contains graphic video and descriptions of violence., Our live coverage of the Louisville bank shooting has moved here., The Louisville Metro Police Department released several minutes of officer body camera footage showing the tense moments between police officers and the gunman outside the Monday bank shooting. Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey walked through several clips of the incident Tuesday evening. Police said it took about three minutes for the nearest responding officers to arrive. Here's what to know: Officer Cory "CJ" Galloway: The gunman in Monday's shooting appeared to be waiting for police officers to arrive, Humphrey said. He said the shooter went to the bank's front lobby "after assaulting the victims in the office area." Footage from Galloway's body camera shows police talking about how they can’t see the shooter and that he is shooting through windows. “Shooter has an angle on that officer!” one officer can be heard saying. “We got to get up there!” he adds.&nbsp;Galloway was Wilt's training officer, according to Humphrey.\nOfficer Nickolas Wilt: The newly sworn-in officer was shown in body camera footage going back into the line of fire to protect other people, Humphrey said. He said since he was new, he was acting based on "his training and his character" and that he "never hesitates." Wilt was shot in the head and is still in critical condition at the hospital, officials said. \nWhat happened next: While police attempted to rescue Wilt after he was shot, Galloway's body camera shows the suspect shooting at them "trying to kill them in their process of trying to save Officer Wilt,” Humphrey said. The gunfire broke the bank windows, allowing Galloway to find a vantage point to see where the gunman was located, Humphrey said. This is when Galloway kills the shooter, the deputy chief said. Galloway suffered a minor gunshot wound.\nBystander video: Another video showed a recording taken by someone in a building across the street. You can see an officer outside the bank.\nBefore police arrived: In addition to the surveillance footage, CNN reported that the shooter, identified as a 25-year-old bank employee,&nbsp;live-streamed the attack&nbsp;on Instagram. The video has been taken down. A city official described the footage to CNN, saying the shooter fired his AR-15-style weapon inside the bank for about a minute and then appeared to wait a minute and a half before police arrived., Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said he is already talking with state lawmakers from both parties about gun reform, one day after a mass shooting at a bank killed five people in his city. Greenberg, who knew one person that was killed, told CNN the victims "should not be dead," as in the case of other people killed by gun violence. While there is a spirit of coming together, he said, “I'm also hopeful we are taking action.” “We have had enough gun violence in Louisville. We have had enough gun violence in our country and it’s time to take action,” he said, pledging to work with other elected officials and community leaders.  Greenberg wants either statewide action in Kentucky or a change to state laws that would allow him to pass reforms in just his city. While he has had preliminary conversations with lawmakers at the state capital on both sides of the aisle, he said more meetings are expected to happen in the coming days to “talk about what we can do together” Police released several minutes of officer body camera video Tuesday evening. And Greenberg said two things stood out to him about the footage —&nbsp;first is the bravery of the officers who ran into the building, and the second was the tragedy of watching the events unfold. “Our city is heartbroken” for those killed, the mayor said when asked how the community is reacting., Juliana Farmer, one of the five people killed in a Louisville bank on Monday, is being remembered by her family as someone who loved life. “Her siblings, they lost a sister. Her children lost a mother. Their children lost a grandmother,” Farmer's aunt, Vicki Brooks-Scott told CNN affiliate WAVE. “I lost a niece.”&nbsp; Farmer, an employee at the bank, had only recently moved to Louisville from Henderson, Brooks-Scott said. “This was her third week on the job," she said.&nbsp; Farmer, 45, leaves behind three children and four grandchildren, Brooks-Scott said. A fifth grandchild is expected to arrive in September, she added. “I’m hoping that this baby will be born on September 20th because that was her birthday,” she said., Editor's note:&nbsp;This post contains graphic descriptions of violence. LMPD Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey detailed the tense moments when police attempted to rescue&nbsp;Officer Nickolas Wilt, who was shot in the head as police rushed to the scene of the shooting early Monday. Wilt, a 26-year-old rookie officer, is in critical condition at a local hospital. He graduated from the police academy just 11 days ago. The gunfire broke the bank windows, allowing Galloway to find a vantage point to see where the gunman was located, Humphrey said. “Once he is able to see the threat, he then engages the threat, shoots and kills the suspect." Galloway suffered a minor gunshot wound., When the shooting was over, officers and teams from other agencies reentered the bank with supplies and started providing medical treatment right away, Louisville Metro Police Department Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey said. After talking to medical staff, Humphrey said it is "100% certainty" that those swift actions saved lives. He said EMS need to ride in the back of the ambulance with the patients, but they were short-staffed, so police officers offered to drive so the EMS workers could treat a victim on the way to the hospital., The gunman in Monday's shooting appeared to be waiting for police officers to arrive at Old National Bank, according to Louisville Metro Police Department Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey.  At a Tuesday news conference, Humphrey said the shooter went to the bank's front lobby "after assaulting the victims in the office area.", Editor's note:&nbsp;This post contains graphic descriptions of violence.

Officer Nickolas Wilt, 26, who ran toward the gunfire, was shot in the head during the incident, police previously announced.  He had graduated from the police academy just 10 days before the shooting, police said. He is in critical condition at the hospital, officials tell CNN., Body camera footage shows that Officer Nickolas Wilt went back into the line of fire to protect people, Louisville Metro Police Department Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey said during a news conference Tuesday.  Humphrey emphasized the role and mission of police is to protect lives and constitutional rights and that's what officers did during the deadly shooting at a Louisville bank Monday.   Humphrey commended Wilt's bravery. Wilt was shot in the head when police confronted the gunman at the bank., Several minutes of police body camera video from the deadly bank shooting in Lousiville, Kentucky, shows the bravery of the responding officers, the department's Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwynn-Villaroel said. The chief said moving forward, it is time for healing and compassion, but added that officers will remain "prepared to face and conquer" future threats. Police previously said officers arrived at the bank three minutes after being notified of the shooting. Three officers were injured, and one had to have brain surgery, officials said., Louisville officials are releasing bodycam footage of Monday's deadly bank shooting and will show it at a news briefing happening now.  According to the Louisville Metro Police Department, the six to seven minutes of bodycam footage will show multiple angles of officers responding to the shooting.  In addition to the surveillance footage, CNN reported that the shooter, identified as a 25-year-old bank employee, live streamed the attack on Instagram. The video has been taken down. A city official described the footage to CNN, saying the shooter fired his AR-15-style weapon inside the bank for about a minute and then appeared to wait a minute and a half before police arrived. Earlier Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Louisville mayor told CNN the office hopes to release the 911 call audio of the shooting on Tuesday., Officer Nickolas Wilt, who was shot in the head when police confronted the gunman at the Louisville bank on Monday, is a volunteer firefighter and is active with the LaGrange Fire and Rescue Department, according to the department's chief Jim Sitzler.&nbsp; He has volunteered with the department since 2016,  “He also worked for Oldham county dispatch as a dispatch and EMS," Sitzler told CNN, who described him as an asset to the department.&nbsp; Sitzler said public service is in Wilt’s DNA.&nbsp; The rookie police officer is still in critical condition after undergoing surgery, Sitzler said., Body camera footage from officers responding to the Louisville bank shooting is expected to be released Tuesday evening, according to Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg. A video package will be played and discussed at a 5 p.m. ET news conference, the mayor said.  According to the Louisville Metro Police Department, six to seven minutes of bodycam footage showing multiple angles of officers responding to the shooting will be released.  Greenberg said the video “will focus on the interactions between the shooter and police" and that it will be “respectful” in terms of sensitivity toward victims. The video will then be uploaded to a YouTube page for distribution. 911 calls related to the incident are not expected to be released Tuesday, the police department's public information officer, Matthew Sanders told CNN., Body camera footage showing the confrontation between police and the gunman who killed five people at a Louisville bank is expected to be released Tuesday evening.   Meantime, police are uncovering new details about the shooter. The department's chief said that the gun used in the attack was purchased less than a week ago. Here's what to know to get up to speed: Timeline: The entire incident lasted about 9 minutes, Louisville Metro Police Department Lt. Col. Aaron Crowell said. The shooting began just after 8:30 a.m. — about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public, police said. It happened during a morning employee meeting, with some appearing in person and others virtually, according to a manager at the bank. The shooter fired his weapon for about a minute and then appeared to wait a minute and a half before police arrived, according to a city official. When officers got there, they shot and killed the gunman, said Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the Louisville Metro Police Department.\nThe weapon: The shooter used an AR-15-style rifle in the attack, which was purchased six days ago, police said. He bought the weapon legally from a local dealership on April 4, Gwinn-Villaroel said. Police also said they executed a search warrant on his house and recovered some other items. Gwinn-Villaroel would not specify what they were.\nVideo of the shooting: The responding officer's body camera footage is expected to be released Tuesday evening, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. Police also said the shooter live-streamed the incident on Instagram. Meta, the parent company of the platform, said that video was taken down. A city official said investigators are in possession of the video.\nDispatcher audio: A Louisville Metro Police dispatcher said in an audio that the gunman had left a voicemail saying he was going to kill everyone at the bank. "He's texted&nbsp;a friend, called a friend, left a voicemail saying he's&nbsp;gonna&nbsp;kill everyone at the bank. Feeling suicidal," the dispatcher said, according to Broadcastify audio.\nVictims: The five victims were identified as Joshua Barrick, 40; Juliana Farmer, 45; Tommy Elliott, 63; James Tutt, 64, and Deana Eckert, 57. \nHospital response: Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer, said his hospital used 170 units of blood on Monday to treat victims from the bank shooting. He credited the Red Cross and blood donations with saving lives. On Tuesday, four patients were still at the University of Louisville Hospital, a spokesperson said. The rookie officer who was shot in the head remains sedated in the intensive care unit, Smith said.\nCalls for action: Greenberg said that 40 people have now been killed by guns this year in his city, and he made a plea for the state and federal governments to take action on gun violence or to cede that power to the city. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat from Kentucky, called for Republicans to pass gun reform policies saying that the issue is not political. Smith said having to treat so many victims of gun violence, day in and day out, has made him grow "weary."\nVigil planned: A local vigil will be held Wednesday at 5 p.m. ET at the Muhammad Ali Center to honor the victims of the shooting and unite as a community, the mayor said., A majority of adults or their family members in the United States have been affected by a gun-related incident, according to a new&nbsp;survey&nbsp;from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Over half of US adults, 54%, have either personally or had a family member who has been impacted by such an incident, such as witnessing a shooting, being threatened by a gun, or been injured or killed by a gun. Nearly 1 in 5 adults has had a family member killed by a gun, including in homicide and suicide. About as many adults have been personally threatened with a gun, and about 1 in 6 adults has witnessed an injury from a shooting, the survey found. The new report came less than a day after a shooter killed five people in Louisville, Kentucky. Mass shootings have escalated in recent years, reaching a record pace in 2023. There have been at least 146&nbsp;incidents&nbsp;so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, leaving more than 200 people dead and hundreds more injured. About half of all gun-related deaths are suicides, federal&nbsp;data&nbsp;shows. And the suicide rate has also recently increased, reversing years of decline and returning to near-record levels. The vast majority of adults say they worry at least sometimes that they or someone in their family will become a victim of gun violence, the new KFF survey found. Nearly a quarter of parents of children younger than 18 say they worry about it daily or almost daily. Guns are now the leading cause of death among children and teens in the US, surpassing car accidents in 2020.  According to the new KFF survey, Black adults are more than twice as likely as White adults to have lost a loved one to gun violence and to have personally witnessed someone being shot. Read more about the survey., Louisville Metro Police Department Lt. Col. Aaron Crowell provided a few more specifics about the timeline of the fatal shooting at a bank Monday that left five dead.  During a briefing on Tuesday, Crowell said that the shooter was "neutralized" approximately three minutes after police responded.  Crowell reiterated that the gun purchased by the shooter in the fatal bank shooting was an AR-15-style rifle.&nbsp; Louisville Interim Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said it was a "targeted" incident, as the shooter — who was an employee of the bank — knew the victims. Police said they don’t know whether armed guards were present in the building. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg added that the shooting took place on the first floor of the bank building, and there were other people in the building at the time who were later cleared from the scene by police.  Authorities said a third officer was injured as a result of the incident, but not from a gunshot wound. CNN's Michelle Krupa contributed to this report., The Louisville Metro Police Department has opened two separate investigations following Monday's shooting at Old National Bank — one under the purview of homicide and another under the scope of its Public Integrity Unit, a police official said. How the events unfolded: The shooting began around 8:30 a.m. ET, police said, about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public. Bank staff were holding their morning meeting in a conference room when the shooter opened fire, bank manager Rebecca Buchheit-Sims said. One bank employee frantically called her husband as she sheltered inside a locked vault, the husband, Caleb Goodlett told CNN affiiliate&nbsp;WLKY. By the time he called 911, police were already aware of the shooting, he said. The gunman, who was still firing when police arrived, was killed in a shootout with officers, police said.  Nickolas Wilt, a 26-year-old rookie officer, ran toward the gunfire and was shot in the head, interim Louisville Metro Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. He had graduated from the police academy just 10 days before the shooting. The officer is sedated in the intensive care unit, Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer at UofL Health, said at Tuesday's news conference. CNN’s John Miller, Laura Ly, Artemis Moshtaghian, Celina Tebor, Caroll Alvarado, Kristina Sgueglia, Sara Smart and Eric Levenson contributed to this report., Dr. Jason Smith, chief medical officer for UofL Health, said having to treat so many victims of gun violence, day in and day out, has made him grow "weary." Smith said that his hospital "barely had to adjust our&nbsp;operating room schedule" on Monday because that's "how&nbsp;frequent we are having to deal&nbsp;with gun violence in our&nbsp;community." He continued: "There's only&nbsp;so many times you can walk into&nbsp;a room. And tell someone they're&nbsp;not coming home tomorrow. And it&nbsp;just breaks your heart. When you&nbsp;hear someone screaming, 'Mommy' or&nbsp;'Daddy.' It just becomes too hard&nbsp;day in and day out to be able to&nbsp;do that." Watch here:, Rep. Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat from Kentucky, called for Republicans to pass gun reform policies saying that the issue is not political.  "I had somebody&nbsp;tell me the other day. Don't&nbsp;make this political.  Fine. Don't&nbsp;make this political. People's&nbsp;lives aren't political. Public&nbsp;safety isn't political. Put&nbsp;those policies in place that put&nbsp;people first. People over guns,&nbsp;kids over guns, public safety&nbsp;over guns. Because that is what we need to address this problem," McGarvey added.  McGarvey discussed crisis aversion legislation that he has introduced to temporarily remove fire arms from those who are going through a crisis. He called on his colleagues to support those efforts in bipartisan way, including pushing for universal background checks.  "We can&nbsp;do this. We can come together at&nbsp;the federal level, working with&nbsp;each other to solve this problem, which is impacting all of us in a uniquely American way," he said.  He then called out the Republicans for working harder on identify politics than on gun reform.  McGarvey said things like getting "weapons of war off our streets" and "helping people who are in crisis" are not a "political issue," but "it becomes one when&nbsp;Kentucky Republicans would rather ban books and pronouns and then make Kentucky&nbsp;a sanctuary state for weapons." "We&nbsp;are hurting. And no matter&nbsp;what&nbsp;policy&nbsp;we&nbsp;passed, no, it&nbsp;will not bring back these&nbsp;people," he added., Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said that 40 people have now been killed by guns this year in his city, giving an impassioned plea for state and federal government to take action on gun violence or to cede that power to the city.  "That level of gun violence&nbsp;is beyond horrific," he said in a Tuesday briefing.  "We have to&nbsp;take action now. We need short-term action to end this gun&nbsp;violence epidemic now so fewer&nbsp;people die on our streets, and in&nbsp;our banks, and in our schools and in our churches. And for&nbsp;that, we need help. We need help&nbsp;from our friends in Frankfurt and help from our friends in&nbsp;Washington, DC.," the mayor said.   As a Democratic candidate for mayor, Greenberg was the target of a shooting at his campaign headquarters. "Last year, I survived a workplace shooting.&nbsp;And&nbsp;now&nbsp;yesterday, I've lost a&nbsp;very close friend in another&nbsp;workplace shooting," the mayor said.  Greenberg said that the state law should be changed to address Louisville's response to gun violence.  "Let us, the people of Louisville, make our own choices about how&nbsp;we reduce gun violence in our&nbsp;city," he said., The man who opened fire at a Louisville bank, killing five people, purchased the weapon he used in the attack six days ago, police said. Louisville Metro Police Department Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said the shooter bought the weapon legally from a local dealership on April 4. Lt. Col. Aaron Crowell said the shooter used an AR-15 rifle in the shooting., Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said a local vigil will be held Wednesday at 5 p.m. ET at the Muhammad Ali Center to honor the victims of Monday's bank shooting and unite as a community., The Louisville Metro Police Department will release body-worn camera footage of Monday's shooting at Old National Bank on Tuesday afternoon, Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel announced., Dr. Jason Smith, chief medical officer for UofL Health, said that his hospital used 170 units of blood on Monday to treat victims from the bank shooting. Smith thanked the American Red Cross and their organization's efforts in getting the hospital additional blood needed for treatment.  He said the blood needed "far outstrips" the hospital's capacity and credited the Red Cross's efforts with helping to save lives., Louisville officials are holding a briefing now on Monday's fatal workplace shooting and the latest on the investigation.  The release about the briefing said officials will “provide updates on the aftermath of Monday’s shooting and announce a planned vigil.” Here's who we expect to speak at the briefing: Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg\nKentucky Rep. Morgan McGarvey\nLouisville Metro Police Department Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel\nDr. Jason Smith, chief medical officer of UofL Health, An additional patient was discharged from UofL Hospital on Tuesday, a hospital spokesperson told CNN. Out of the nine patients originally hospitalized:  Four have been discharged\nFour remain in the hospital\nOne has died One of the four patients in the hospital is in critical condition, and the other three are in stable and fair condition, according to the hospital spokesperson. CNN reported Monday that a fifth victim had died later in the day. CNN also reported that a rookie Louisville police officer – who graduated from the police academy just 10 days ago –  underwent brain surgery after being shot in the head, police said Monday.  The interim police chief told CNN Tuesday morning that the officer was still in critical condition, but stable. Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer at UofL Health, later added at a news conference that the officer is sedated in the intensive care unit., James “Jim” Tutt, one of the victims of Monday's Old National Bank shooting, was a “huge fan and supporter” of the downtown Louisville area and actively helped to promote it, Rebecca Fleischaker, the executive director of the Downtown Development Corporation, told CNN.&nbsp; Tutt was on the board of the Downtown Development Corporation since 2018 and recently served as treasurer, according to Fleischaker.  The nonprofit organization works on improving the Louisville downtown area by promoting redevelopment, vitality, economic growth, and a safe environment, according to their website. Tutt, who was 64 and a native of Frankfort, Kentucky, worked as the commercial real estate (CRE) market executive at Old National Bank in downtown Louisville since 2015, his LinkedIn shows. “The Louisville Downtown Partnership staff send our love and heartfelt condolences to his wife and family as well as his Old National family, for enduring what should be the unthinkable,” Fleischaker said., Body camera footage of the police response to the Louisville shooting will be released within the next 24 to 48 hours, according to Kevin Trager, spokesperson at the mayor’s office. He also said the footage&nbsp;will not&nbsp;be released at the upcoming 11:30 a.m. ET briefing with officials, The Louisville Metro Police Department is planning a meeting Tuesday to go over what videos might be released related to Monday's shooting at Old National Bank. The department will also discuss the process of showing the videos to the families so they can view them first before they are released to news organizations, according to a law enforcement source. Police intend to release the videos before this evening, and there could be an evening news conference, the source said., Five patients are still being treated at University of Louisville Hospital on Tuesday, with one patient upgraded from critical to fair condition, a hospital spokesperson told CNN. One of the five patients is still in critical condition, and the other four are in stable and fair condition.&nbsp; Nine patients in total, including three Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) officers, were treated at the hospital following Monday’s shooting, the spokesperson said. Three of those patients have been discharged. Five of the nine patients sustained gunshot wounds, and one of the patients died Monday night. LMPD identified the patient who died as 57-year-old Deana Eckert., Investigators combing through Instagram video of the shooting saw firsthand the horror that unfolded Monday, watching the shooter fire his AR-15-style weapon inside the bank for about a minute and then appearing to wait a minute and a half before police arrive, according to a city official.  It’s unclear why the gunman stopped shooting.&nbsp; The video shows that his attack on bank workers lasted about a minute, the official told CNN. The live stream begins with the clearly visible AR-15-style weapon before a worker inside the bank says good morning to the gunman, according to the official. “You need to get out of here,” the shooter is heard saying to the woman on the live stream, which was eventually taken down by Instagram’s parent company Meta.&nbsp; According to that official, the gunman then tries to shoot her in the back but can’t because the safety is on and the weapon still needed to be loaded, the official said. Once the shooter loads the weapon properly and takes the safety off, he shoots the worker in the back, the official said. Her condition is not known.&nbsp; The shooter then continues his rampage, firing at workers while they try to outrun the gunman, the official said.  The shooter does not go to other floors of the bank where workers were already present, the official said.&nbsp; Once the shooter was done firing, he sat down in the lobby area that looks out onto East Main Street and&nbsp;appears to wait&nbsp;for police, the official said. The gunman waited roughly a minute and a half before police arrived and engaged the shooter in the gun battle, according to the official., Authorities "will make every effort" to release body camera and surveillance footage of the bank shooting "as soon as possible," Louisville Metro Police spokesperson Aaron Ellis said. “We are still in the infancy of this investigation,” he added. A spokesperson for the Louisville mayor also told CNN the office hopes to release the 911 call audio of Monday's shooting at Old National Bank later Tuesday.  The mayor has seen the surveillance footage, the spokesperson said.&nbsp; “It’s clear the initial responding officers immediately engaged the shooter,” the spokesperson said, adding the officers undoubtedly saved lives and noting there were other people in the building. Separately, a Louisville Metro Police dispatcher said in an audio that the gunman, identified as Connor Sturgeon, had left a voicemail saying he was going to kill everyone at the bank. "He's texted&nbsp;a friend, called a friend, left a voicemail saying he's&nbsp;gonna&nbsp;kill everyone at the bank. Feeling suicidal," the dispatcher said in the audio, according to Broadcastify audio. Editor’s Note:&nbsp;If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 (or&nbsp;800-273-8255) to connect with a trained counselor or visit the&nbsp;NSPL site. CNN's Michelle Watson&nbsp;contributed reporting to this post., Old National Bank CEO Jim Ryan and other members of the bank’s leadership team are in Louisville Tuesday to provide support to individuals affected by Monday's mass shooting, according to a statement from the bank, which adds that they will continue to be there in the days ahead. "Obviously, this is an incredibly difficult situation, and our entire focus is on making sure that everyone affected has the support and assistance they need," the CEO’s statement reads. “On behalf of everyone at Old National, I also want to acknowledge and thank Louisville law enforcement, the medical community and state and local officials for their incredible response to this tragedy. And finally, we ask you to please continue to pray for all those affected.”, The shooting at Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, began around 8:30 a.m. ET, police said, about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public. Bank staff were holding their morning meeting in a conference room when the shooter opened fire, Rebecca Buchheit-Sims, the bank manager, said. One bank employee frantically called her husband as she sheltered inside a locked vault, the husband, Caleb Goodlett told CNN affiiliate&nbsp;WLKY. By the time he called 911, police were already aware of the shooting, he said. “Just a very traumatic phone call to get,” Goodlett told the affiliate, adding that he has since seen his wife and she is OK. The gunman, who was still firing when police arrived, was killed in a shootout with officers, police officials said.  Nickolas Wilt, a 26-year-old rookie officer, ran toward the gunfire and was shot in the head, interim Louisville Metro Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. He had graduated from the police academy just 10 days before the shooting. Wilt underwent brain surgery and was in critical but stable condition as of Monday afternoon, the chief said. The gun used in the shooting was an AR-15-style rifle, a federal law enforcement source told CNN. The semi-automatic rifle is the most popular sporting rifle in the US, and 30% of gun owners reported having owned an AR-15 or similar-style rifle, according to the 2021&nbsp;National Firearms Survey. The AR-15 and its offshoots have been the weapon of choice in many of the most horrific mass shootings in recent memory, including the Covenant school shooting in Nashville just two weeks ago. The bank sits on the fringe of Louisville’s developing downtown business district, state&nbsp;Sen. Gerald Neal, who represents the district where the shooting happened, told CNN.&nbsp; CNN’s John Miller, Laura Ly, Artemis Moshtaghian, Celina Tebor, Caroll Alvarado, Kristina Sgueglia, Sara Smart and Eric Levenson contributed to this report., Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg praised his community after a bank shooting Monday that left five people dead. In a CNN interview alongside Louisville Metro Police Department Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, Greenberg — who said he himself is a survivor of gun violence in the workplace — encouraged those impacted by the shooting to "take time with loved ones." The mayor said his friend Tommy Elliott, who was killed in the shooting, was a "great friend" and "the definition of loyalty." Elliott was also a friend to Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and others around the city, he said.&nbsp; He recounted having not known whether another friend had survived yesterday's attack. The mayor said when he saw his friend in the hospital, he was overwhelmed. "We both survived," the mayor said he told his friend, encouraging him to see a therapist and talk to professionals. While the mayor said he doesn’t personally know the others who died, from the stories he has heard, "they are wonderful as well.", In an interview with CNN, Louisville's interim police chief offered few further details about the developing investigation into the fatal workplace shooting at a downtown bank in the Kentucky city, revealing that the gunman recently purchased the weapon used in the shooting without providing any more information. Louisville Metro Interim Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel confirmed that police searched the suspect's home Monday, adding she hopes the items that were recovered will help shed light on the motive. She did not say whether any other search warrants were executed. Asked about a note the shooter wrote indicating he was going to carry out a shooting at the bank, the interim chief said the investigation was in preliminary stages. She said that Officer Nickolas Wilt, who was shot in the head while responding to the shooting, was in critical but stable condition and “looking better.” Wilt graduated from the police academy less than two weeks ago. She asked for prayers for him and the families of others who lost their lives to “senseless” violence., Meta, the parent company of Instagram, confirmed that they took down a live-stream video of the Louisville bank shooting. "We are in touch with law enforcement and quickly removed the live stream," a Meta spokesperson said.&nbsp; Meta declined to comment if the video was taken down on its own or at the request of law enforcement.&nbsp; Sources previously told CNN that the&nbsp;shooting was live streamed on Instagram and has been take down but not immediately after the shooting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Police are in possession of the video, according to the source., The mass shooting at the Old National Bank on East Main Street in Louisville, Kentucky, began just after 8:30 a.m. — about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public, police said. It happened during a morning employee meeting, with some appearing in person and others virtually, Rebecca Buchheit-Sims, a manager at the bank, told CNN. She watched from her computer as her coworkers were gunned down. “I witnessed people being murdered. I don’t know how else to say that,” Buchheit-Sims said.&nbsp; Buchheit-Sims said she didn’t directly work with the gunman, Connor Sturgeon, but knew him because his father was her son’s high school basketball coach, and her husband was an assistant coach.&nbsp; “Just kind of a monotone personality,” she said of Sturgeon. “His temperament is pretty low key. I’ve never seen the kid get angry or upset about anything in public. He was pretty much just relaxed.”, President Joe Biden spoke over the phone&nbsp;with Kentucky Gov. Andy&nbsp;Beshear&nbsp;on Monday evening about the bank shooting yesterday in Louisville, the White House said. He had earlier condemned the latest mass shooting and called on Congress to&nbsp;act on gun reform., At least five people were killed and nine others were taken to the hospital after a gunman opened fire at Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, Monday morning. Here's what we know so far: Shooter:&nbsp;Police identified the gunman as Connor Sturgeon, 25, who was an employee at the bank. (At a news conference earlier Monday, police had described the shooter as a 23-year-old male. They amended his age&nbsp;Monday afternoon.) Sturgeon was notified that&nbsp;he was going to be fired,&nbsp;according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation, and he wrote a note that indicated that he was going to carry out a shooting at the bank. He was killed by police shortly after opening fire, according to Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the department.\nResponse:&nbsp;Officers arrived at the bank three minutes after the first call of the shooting, Gwinn-Villaroel said, adding that the fast response time saved lives. She said the gunman used a rifle.\nInvestigation:&nbsp;Police did not have&nbsp;"any prior engagement"&nbsp;with the shooter, according to Gwinn-Villaroel. Investigators are working to learn more about him. The gunman&nbsp;live streamed&nbsp;the attack on Instagram, police said. The video was subsequently taken down.\nVictims:&nbsp;Four of the victims who died Monday were identified as Joshua Barrick, 40; Juliana Farmer, 45; Tommy Elliott, 63; and James Tutt, 64, the chief said. Later that evening, police said a fifth victim – 57-year-old Deana Eckert – also died. Several victims remain hospitalized, including a police officer in critical condition after a shootout with the gunman.\nReaction:&nbsp;President Joe Biden condemned the latest mass shooting and called on Congress to&nbsp;act on gun reform. Democratic Rep. Morgan McGarvery, who represents Louisville in Congress, and state Sen. Karen Berg, who also represents parts of the city, also&nbsp;called for action&nbsp;to address gun violence. Gov.

Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021, was found&nbsp;guilty&nbsp;Tuesday of all four counts of involuntary manslaughter in a&nbsp;novel legal case&nbsp;that stood as a test of the limits of who’s responsible for a school shooting.\nCrumbley, 45, faces up to 15 years in prison, and her sentencing hearing is set for April 9. She has been behind bars since her&nbsp;arrest in a Detroit warehouse&nbsp;days after the shooting.\nHer husband, James Crumbley, is scheduled to go to trial on the same charges in early March. Our live coverage has ended. Scroll through the posts below to read about today's verdict., A jury found Jennifer Crumbley guilty of manslaughter after her son killed four students at a Michigan high school in 2021. The shooter's father, James Crumbley, is set to go to trial next month. There have been several other cases in which parents were charged for shootings carried out by their children, though not one in a school mass shooting. For example,&nbsp;the father of the July 4 mass shooter in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, Illinois,&nbsp;was accused of wrongdoing for&nbsp;signing his son’s application&nbsp;for an&nbsp;Illinois Firearm Owners Identification card&nbsp;months after his son displayed concerning behavior. The father, Robert Crimo Jr., ultimately&nbsp;pleaded guilty&nbsp;to misdemeanor reckless conduct charges and agreed to serve 60 days in jail. In a similar vein, the mother of a&nbsp;6-year-old boy who shot his teacher&nbsp;at a Virginia school last year faced charges. The boy’s mother ultimately pleaded guilty to a&nbsp;state child neglect charge&nbsp;and felony charges of unlawful use of a controlled substance while possessing a firearm and making a false statement while purchasing a firearm. But, the level of severity in the case of the Crumbleys is different. In a&nbsp;written opinion filed last March, a&nbsp;panel of judges for the state’s appellate court acknowledged the possible precedent-setting nature of these cases but called the situation unique and unusual. Joey Jackson, a CNN legal analyst, said the prosecution’s broad goal in bringing these cases was to deter other parents., The jury foreperson in the trial of Jennifer Crumbley — the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021 — said the fact that Crumbley was the last adult&nbsp;seen&nbsp;with the gun before the shooting “really hammered it home.”&nbsp; “Lives hung in the balance, and we took that very seriously,” the woman, who identified herself as the foreperson in the courtroom and who read the jury's verdict, said. She declined to give her name. She said “both sides were well represented” when asked whether the jurors had to convince each other while deliberating.&nbsp; During her closing arguments, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald put up a photo of Jennifer Crumbley leaving the gun range on November 27, 2021, carrying the gun in a case that her son used in the shooting. “This is the last picture we have of that gun until we see it murder four kids on November 30, and the person holding it is Jennifer Crumbley. She’s the last person we see with that gun,” McDonald said., James Crumbley, whose son killed four people in a mass shooting at a Michigan high school in 2021, is set to go to trial on March 5. He has pleaded not guilty to four charges of involuntary manslaughter for his alleged role in the shooting. It comes after the shooter's mother, Jennifer Crumbley, was found guilty of the same charges on Tuesday. The evidence and arguments in James Crumbley's trial may differ. At first, they had been working toward a joint defense, but their cases were separated after their defense learned of a conflict between the two. According to a prosecution filing from last year, Jennifer Crumbley “placed blame” on her husband in the shooting, leading to the split. Why this is important: In bringing manslaughter charges, prosecutors alleged the gunman’s parents are also responsible for the students’ deaths — a novel and unusual legal theory.  Parents have been charged for their child’s actions before, but not in this specific way, according to Misty Marris, a trial attorney who has followed the case., Jennifer Crumbley was convicted of four counts of involuntary manslaughter Tuesday afternoon. She pleaded not guilty to all four counts for her role in the November 30, 2021,&nbsp;mass shooting at Oxford High School, which left four students dead and seven other people wounded, including a teacher.&nbsp; Here's what both sides argued during the trial: The prosecution argued Crumbley was responsible for the deaths because she was “grossly negligent” in giving a gun to her son Ethan, who was 15 at the time, and failing to get him proper mental health treatment despite warning signs. Over a week of testimony, law enforcement officials, school employees, shooting victims and those who knew Jennifer Crumbley testified for the prosecution.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe defense argued the blame laid elsewhere: on her husband for improperly securing the firearm; on the school for failing to notify her about her son’s behavioral issues; and on Ethan himself, who planned and carried out the attack on his own. Defense attorney Shannon Smith said the case was “dangerous” for parents everywhere.&nbsp;During her trial, Jennifer Crumbley took the stand in her own defense and said she wouldn't have done anything differently.\nThe big picture: Broadly, the prosecution’s case relied on an unusual and novel legal strategy and represents an attempt to expand the scope of blame in mass shootings. And in its specifics, the trial provided an intimate view of the collapse of one American family.&nbsp;Crumbley’s husband, James, is scheduled to go on trial on the same charges in early March., Craig Shilling, the father of Justin Shilling, one of the four students killed in the 2021 mass shooting at Oxford High School, said the guilty verdict for the mother of the shooter was emotional. “It was a long time coming, but it's definitely a step toward accountability," Shilling told reporters outside the courtroom on Tuesday. Jennifer Crumbley was found guilty of four counts of manslaughter and is set to be sentenced on April 9. Each count carries a maximum punishment of up to 15 years in prison, which would run concurrently.&nbsp; He said parents need to address “things at every level” and there’s “no way to look the other way” now. In the case of Jennifer Crumbley, the father said many things could have stopped the shooting before it started. "You cannot choose to take your&nbsp;own interests over your child,&nbsp;especially when it comes to&nbsp;mental health and addressing,&nbsp;you know, concerns, the&nbsp;problem.&nbsp;Everything about that was&nbsp;disturbing," Shilling said., Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald hugged the fathers of Justin Shilling and Madisyn Baldwin before she left the courtroom. Both 17-year-olds were killed in the mass shooting at Oxford High School on November 30, 2021.  Hana St. Juliana, 14, and Tate Myre, 16, were also killed in the shooting.&nbsp;Six other students and a teacher were injured., Jennifer Crumbley, who was&nbsp;convicted of four counts of involuntary manslaughter Tuesday, is scheduled to be sentenced on April 9. Each charge carries a maximum punishment of up to 15 years in prison. Crumbley’s husband, James, is scheduled to go on trial on the same charges in early March. Their son Ethan pleaded guilty to one count of&nbsp;terrorism&nbsp;causing death, four counts of murder and 19 other charges related to the deadly rampage. He was sentenced last year to&nbsp;life in prison without parole., Jennifer Crumbley remained looking down during the verdict. A jury found her guilty of manslaughter following a 2021 Michigan school shooting in which her son killed four students. There were no audible reactions in the gallery, but there were some tears. Two rows in the gallery were reserved for family of the victims. Crumbley left the courtroom shackled.  Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald went to hug two parents of victims before she left the courtroom. A few other prosecutors shook the parents’ hands as well., Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in a trial that stood as a test of the limits of who’s responsible for a school shooting.&nbsp; Jennifer Crumbley was convicted of four counts of involuntary manslaughter, a charge that comes with a maximum punishment of up to 15 years in prison for each count., As Michigan jurors deliberated on four counts of involuntary manslaughter against Jennifer Crumbley on Monday, they sent two questions separately to the judge. Here's what they were: The jury sent their first question after deliberating for just over two hours: The jury sought for clarification on instructions, asking if there are different ways to convict&nbsp;Crumbley. Judge Cheryl Matthews decided to tell them yes, and referred the jury to re-read part of her instructions, which says “the prosecutor asserts two different theories to support the charges of Involuntary Manslaughter.” The first theory is that Crumbley committed involuntary manslaughter because she failed to perform a legal duty. The second, is because she was grossly negligent.&nbsp; "Those theories are two different ways to prove the same crime. Either or both of these theories, if proven, are sufficient to establish the crime of involuntary manslaughter," the instructions explain. The second question came an hour later: The jury asked if they can infer anything from evidence or witnesses that the prosecution did not bring, specifically not bring in the shooter or other people who could answer how specifically Ethan Crumbley got the gun. Judge Matthews brought the jury in to tell them they can only consider the evidence that was brought in at trial., A jury has reached a verdict in the manslaughter trial of Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021, in a trial that stands as a test of the limits of who’s responsible for a school shooting.&nbsp; She faces four counts of involuntary manslaughter. The verdict will be read in court shortly., A jury has reached a verdict in the manslaughter trial of Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021. Jennifer Crumbley is on trial for manslaughter in a case that will test the limits of who is responsible for a mass shooting. She pleaded not guilty to four charges of involuntary manslaughter for their alleged&nbsp;roles in her son’s rampage, which left four students dead and seven others wounded. She faces up to 15 years in prison. Her husband, James, is scheduled to go to trial on the same charges in early March. In bringing manslaughter charges, prosecutors alleged the gunman’s parents are also responsible for the students’ deaths – a novel and unusual legal theory. In particular, prosecutors accuse the gunman’s parents of disregarding the risks when they bought a gun for their son four days before the shooting, even though he was struggling with his mental health and contemplating violence. They also say the parents did not mention the gun to school officials in a meeting to discuss Ethan’s disturbing drawings just hours before the fatal shooting., A jury has reached a verdict in the manslaughter trial of Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021. The verdict will be read soon. Her son Ethan Crumbley&nbsp;was sentenced to life in prison without parole in December for the shooting, which left another wounding six students and a teacher injured. In that sentencing, Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Kwamé Rowe dismissed last-minute defense pleas that Crumbley’s life is salvageable and noted that the “defendant in his own words” told the court “this is nobody’s fault but his own.” Rowe said victim Justin Shilling, 17, was shot at point-blank range after being told by the defendant to get on his knees. Hana St. Juliana, 14, was shot a second time after she was down, he said, “to finish the job by shooting her again.” “That is an execution. That is torture. He shot most people multiple times. And, as he wrote, he did this for notoriety. And he wanted to go down … as the biggest school shooter in Michigan history.”, Jennifer Crumbley sent several messages criticizing her own parenting ability and discussing how the family’s firearm was secured shortly after her teenage son Ethan carried out a school shooting at his Michigan high school in November 2021, according to messages revealed in court Wednesday. Jennifer Crumbley wrote the messages as part of a lengthy conversation with Brian Meloche, a firefighter captain who testified he was in an extramarital romantic relationship with her at the time of the shooting. In several messages shown in court Wednesday, Jennifer Crumbley stated how the firearm used in the shooting was stored and secured. On the morning of the shooting, she said she had to go to her son’s school because she was worried he “was going to do something dumb,” Meloche testified. He responded by asking where her firearm was, and Jennifer said the gun was in her vehicle, he testified. However, other testimony has shown that the gun was in Ethan Crumbley’s backpack at school. Meloche also testified that he recalled telling Jennifer Crumbley to call 911 when she realized the gun was missing. He acknowledged that he deleted these and other messages from Facebook. A prosecutor told the jury that messages that were deleted by him and Crumbley could not be recovered by law enforcement., https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240201180525-jennifer-crumbley-trial-02012024-super-tease.jpeg, https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240201180525-jennifer-crumbley-trial-02012024-super-tease.jpeg, https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240201180525-jennifer-crumbley-trial-02012024-super-tease.jpeg, https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/w_460/5b22dd4a-c3df-48af-a0c8-28d8586d0dec.jpg, https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240201180525-jennifer-crumbley-trial-02012024-super-tease.jpeg, https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/w_460/04011236-3a3e-49cd-a2ff-b0c6d26ce223.jpg, https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/w_460/90134ca8-fe8d-43b5-9466-b839498f9f46.jpg, https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/w_460/c9179f38-56e2-4c01-b209-58bd72eda484.jpg, https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240201180525-jennifer-crumbley-trial-02012024-super-tease.jpeg, https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/w_460/1d094c03-2095-4525-aa79-6efc4abd23e5.jpg, https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240201180525-jennifer-crumbley-trial-02012024-super-tease.jpeg, https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/w_460/2c6f76e8-7ac1-42c1-9f72-5c87d6cc36ca.jpg, https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240201180525-jennifer-crumbley-trial-02012024-super-tease.jpeg, https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/w_460/11a5ccce-c645-4a23-a557-6eb78498ba99.jpg, https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240201180525-jennifer-crumbley-trial-02012024-super-tease.jpeg

police said. The shooter's "weapon of choice" was a rifle and he was shot and killed by law enforcement, police said.\nThe gunman live-streamed the attack on Instagram, police said. The video was subsequently taken down, according to the source. \nA local hospital received nine patients following the shooting – two police officers and seven civilians, officials said. Three patients have been released and three are in critical condition, including a police officer, authorities added., Our live coverage of the Louisville bank shooting has moved here., The death toll in the Louisville bank shooting has risen to five, the Louisville Metro Police Department said late Monday., President Joe Biden spoke by phone to Kentucky Gov. Andy&nbsp;Beshear&nbsp;Monday evening about the shooting at a Louisville bank that left four people dead, the White House said. In a statement earlier Monday, Biden called out Republicans for what he said is a lack of action to protect communities. He said Congress needs to act on things like requiring safe storage of guns and background checks., A survivor of workplace gun violence himself, Louisville Mayor&nbsp;Craig Greenberg said he lost a very close friend, Thomas Elliot, in the Old National Bank shooting.  Greenberg said he was with Elliot's wife at the hospital earlier Monday morning. Elliot, a senior vice president at the bank, was also a close friend of Gov. Andy Beshear.  The mayor said he also visited Louisville Metro Police Officer Nickolas Wilt at the University of Louisville hospital saying he “made it through surgery and he's in serious condition at the hospital right now, but he is in great hands.”&nbsp; Greenberg said he handed Wilt his graduation diploma from the police academy just a week and a half ago., Rebecca Buchheit-Sims, a manager with Old National Bank, told CNN she virtually witnessed the shooting Monday through her computer during a Microsoft Teams meeting.&nbsp; “I’m just as much in shock and disbelief and was in disbelief as I watched it unravel,” she said of the incident, which she said “happened very quickly.”&nbsp; Buchheit-Sims said she didn’t directly work with the gunman, Connor Sturgeon, but knew him because his father was her son’s high school basketball coach, and her husband was an assistant coach.&nbsp; She described Sturgeon as someone with “just kind of a monotone personality."  “His temperament is pretty low-key. I’ve never seen the kid get angry or upset about anything in public. He was pretty much just relaxed," she said.  Buchheit-Sims said she didn’t know anything about Sturgeon having any grievances or previously making any threats. She recalled him as “extremely intelligent.”, At least four people were killed and nine others were taken to the hospital after a gunman opened fire at Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, Monday morning. Here's what we know so far: Shooter: Police identified the gunman as Connor Sturgeon, 25, who was an employee at the bank. (At a news conference earlier Monday, police had described the shooter as a 23-year-old male. They amended his age Monday afternoon.) Sturgeon was notified that he was going to be fired, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation, and wrote a note that indicated that he was going to shoot at the bank. He was killed by police shortly after opening fire, according to Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the department. \nResponse: Officers arrived at the bank three minutes after the first call of the shooting, Gwinn-Villaroel said, adding that the fast response time saved lives. She said the gunman used a rifle.\nInvestigation: Police did not have "any prior engagement" with the shooter, according to Gwinn-Villaroel. Investigators are working to learn more about the gunman. The shooting was live-streamed, Gwinn-Villaroel said, and that police are "hopeful" that they can get the footage taken offline.\nVictims: The four people killed were identified as Tommy Elliott, 63, Jim Tutt, 64, Josh Barrick, 40, and Juliana Farmer, 45, according to updated information from the police department. Nine people were taken to the hospital, said Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer at the University of Louisville Health. Three people have since been discharged, he said. Three others are in critical condition, including a recently graduated police officer who was shot in the head and had to have brain surgery, Gwinn-Villaroel said. One other officer was also injured.\nReaction: President Joe Biden condemned the latest mass shooting and called on Congress to act on gun reform. Democratic Rep. Morgan McGarvery, who represents Louisville in Congress, and State Sen. Karen Berg, who also represents parts of the city, also called for action to address gun violence. Gov.

In a&nbsp;statement Monday, Greenberg called the shooting at Old National Bank “another horrific tragedy” and asked for prayers for the “recovery of those who are receiving medical care, the families of those who lost a loved one, and those who are scared and heartbroken by what has happened this morning.” “Our deepest gratitude to the heroic efforts of first responders, who arrived within minutes of being called, and who risked their lives to save others. We will continue to provide updates throughout the day,” Greenberg said.  CNN’s Artemis Moshtaghian contributed to this report., White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday repeatedly called on Congress to take actions to address gun violence, refusing to explicitly say whether President Joe Biden has exhausted all legal efforts to further combat the issue through executive action.&nbsp; When asked during the White House press briefing if the president is at the end of his ability to do more on gun violence prevention, Jean-Pierre said, “So, there [are] actions that we have taken. The thing is the president cannot do it alone… there is a legislative process that needs to happen and Congress needs to act.”&nbsp; The comments came hours after&nbsp;four people were killed in a mass shooting&nbsp;at a Louisville, Kentucky, bank.&nbsp; Specifically, she added, Biden cannot work without Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage for firearms, require background checks for all gun safeties and eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.&nbsp; Pressed on whether the president has done all he can, Jean-Pierre said, “We're always going to find and figure out ways that we can take another step outside of all of the historic steps that this president has taken to announce another way to protect communities, but the president has done the work. Now we need Congress to act.”&nbsp; She said Biden has "done a historic amount of work recently" and pointed to a bipartisan bill he signed into law that year. Jean-Pierre also clarified that the administration is continuing to call on Congress to pass an assault weapons ban, even though that was not mentioned in the president’s recent statement in response to the Louisville shooting.&nbsp; She said it was “not a shift in strategy at all. We were just being mindful to the incoming information that was currently coming in from Louisville.”, Louisville shooter Connor Sturgeon was notified that he was going to be terminated from Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation.&nbsp; Sturgeon wrote a note for his parents and a friend indicating that he was going to shoot at the bank, the source said.&nbsp;    It is not clear whether that note was on paper or emailed, or whether it was seen before the incident or after, according to the source.&nbsp; The shooting was live-streamed on Instagram and has been taken down.&nbsp;Police are in possession of the video, according to the source., Connor Sturgeon, the 25-year-old identified by police as the gunman in Monday's mass shooting in Louisville, had worked for more than a year at the bank where he allegedly shot 13 people, killing&nbsp;at least&nbsp;four. At a news conference earlier Monday, police had described the shooter as a 23-year-old male. They amended his age to 25 later in the day.)  Sturgeon wrote on&nbsp;his LinkedIn profile&nbsp;that he interned at Old National Bank in Louisville for three consecutive summers between 2018 and 2020 before joining as a Commercial Development Professional in June 2021. He became a Syndications Associate and Portfolio Banker at the bank in April 2022, according to the profile. Sturgeon graduated from the University of Alabama in December 2020, according to a spokesperson for the university. He participated in an accelerated master's program, and earned both his bachelor's degree and a master's degree in finance at the same time, the spokesperson, Shane Dorrill, said. Earlier, Sturgeon&nbsp;played basketball&nbsp;and&nbsp;ran track&nbsp;for his high school in a Louisville suburb, and was&nbsp;named&nbsp;a semifinalist for a National Merit Scholarship in 2015, according to local news reports. A former high school classmate of Sturgeon’s who knew him and his family well said he never saw any “sort of red flag or signal that this could ever happen.” In a 2018&nbsp;college essay&nbsp;posted to the website CourseHero, a user identified as a University of Alabama student named Connor Sturgeon wrote that he had had trouble fitting in at school. “My self-esteem has long been a problem for me,” the essay read. “As a late bloomer in middle and high school, I struggled to a certain extent to fit in, and this has given me a somewhat negative self-image that persists today. Making friends has never been especially easy, so I have more experience than most in operating alone.” The author wrote that in college, he had “begun to mature socially and am beginning to see improvement in this area,” and that he hoped to “be more self-aware and start becoming a ‘better’ person.” Sturgeon's father, Todd Sturgeon,&nbsp;was head&nbsp;coach of&nbsp;the men’s basketball team at the University of Indianapolis for 10 years and later coached basketball and taught US history at his son’s high school, according to&nbsp;news reports&nbsp;and&nbsp;his LinkedIn profile. A 2007&nbsp;story&nbsp;published by Todd Sturgeon’s alma mater, DePauw University, quoted an Indianapolis Star article about his retirement from the University of Indianapolis that year, in which he said that watching his son Connor had inspired him to step down from the team. “Todd Sturgeon said he was watching his son, Connor, at a basketball camp recently when he had a realization: Maybe he'd rather have more time to spend with his own sons than other people's,” the article said., All state flags throughout Kentucky have been ordered to fly at half-staff until Friday evening to honor the victims of the Louisville bank shooting, Gov.

Law enforcement sources said a search of the suspect's last known address was conducted by FBI SWAT teams Thursday.\nRobert Card, 40, is facing an arrest warrant for eight counts of murder and should be considered armed and dangerous, police said. He is a certified firearms instructor and a member of the US Army Reserves, according to law enforcement.\nPolice are urging residents to shelter in place and report any suspicious activity to authorities. Lewiston is the state's second-largest city and is located about 36 miles north of Portland.\nThe rampage in Maine is the deadliest US mass shooting since&nbsp;the Uvalde school massacre. It adds to a grim docket of 565 such incidents, where four or more people are shot excluding the shooter, across the country this year, according to the&nbsp;Gun Violence Archive., Our live coverage of the hunt for the suspect in the Maine mass shooting has moved here, A shooting rampage in Lewiston, Maine, left 18 dead and 13 more injured Wednesday evening after a gunman opened fire on a bowling alley and a restaurant.  Lewiston is a sprawling residential and industrial area just off the Maine Turnpike and is home to two hospitals and the private liberal arts school Bates College. It’s a largely working-class community, with a median household income of about $48,000 and in which about 16% of the population lives in poverty, according to the&nbsp;US Census. Maine Gov. Janet Mills governor, who met her husband in Lewiston, described it as a “special place.” President Joe Biden has spoken by phone with Maine lawmakers and “offered full federal support in the wake of this horrific attack,” the White House said in a statement. Lewiston Mayor&nbsp;Carl Sheline is “heartbroken for our city and our people,” he said. “Lewiston is known for our strength and grit and we will need both in the days to come.” Lewiston Auburn Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce President Shanna Cox on Thursday called the scene of both attacks “family locations.” “It was family league activity at the bowling alley. The likeliness of this having direct impact for so many here is so real.” Auburn Mayor Jason Levesque lost friends in the shooting, he told “CNN This Morning.” A teenager who went to school with his son was shot and is expected to recover, he said. “There’s going to be very few people in this community that have not been touched by this,” he said. “It’s going to be with me for the rest of my life, and it’s really hard for me to explain that.” “The other folks that I knew that were there either as witnesses or family members of witnesses; it’s obviously traumatic,” Levesque said. “The bright spot was seeing individuals reunified with their loved ones after not knowing for so long, but on the on the other side, the ones that were waiting and waiting, probably would never be reunified.”, Peyton Brewer-Ross, 39, was participating in a cornhole tournament at Schemengees Bar and Grille when he was killed during Wednesday’s mass shooting in Lewiston, his brother Ralph Brewer told CNN.&nbsp; Brewer-Ross loved playing cornhole and enjoying hanging out with friends at Schemengees, his brother said. “It’s just surreal and sad. Now my brother is not here anymore along with 17 other people,” Brewer told CNN in a phone interview on Thursday. “He just went to play cornhole. He is the nicest person you would ever meet. He never had a bad thing to say about anyone.” Brewer-Ross “loved being a dad more than anything else,” his brother said. Two weeks ago, Brewer-Ross celebrated his daughter Elle's second birthday.&nbsp; In the past five years, Brewer-Ross worked his way through the iron pipefitter apprenticeship program and graduated last year. When he wasn’t spending time with his family, he enjoyed comics, cornhole, playing games and having fun with friends, his brother said.&nbsp; “We are walking around in a daze not knowing what to say, what to do, or how to act, because of a senseless shooting,” Brewer said. “It’s so unbelievable that this can continue to happen over and over again and nothing changes.”, The town of Lisbon, Maine, is asking residents to continue to shelter in place throughout the overnight hours as officials continue to search for the suspect in Wednesday night's deadly mass shooting. All Lisbon schools and town-owned buildings will be closed tomorrow, the update noted.&nbsp; Lisbon is about eight miles southeast of Lewiston, where the shooting rampage unfolded on Wednesday evening., Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) SWAT teams on Thursday conducted a search of the last known address associated with Robert Card, the suspect in a Wednesday night shooting rampage that left 18 people dead in Lewiston, law enforcement sources told CNN. The&nbsp;sources&nbsp;told CNN that&nbsp;once FBI SWAT&nbsp;teams cleared the house, investigators came in to execute the&nbsp;search&nbsp;warrant, looking for items like computers, notes, weapons and any evidence that&nbsp;might indicate a plan to carry out the&nbsp;shootings. Card, 40, is facing an arrest warrant for eight counts of murder and should be considered armed and dangerous, police said. State and local investigators did a similar style entry and search at another location, as well as a search of Card's car on Thursday, the sources told CNN. Law enforcement officials returned to the Lewiston shooting suspect's last known address on Thursday evening, according to CNN teams on site. At least five law enforcement vehicles, including an armored vehicle, were seen at the scene, CNN reported. A spokesperson with the Maine Department of Public Safety told CNN law enforcement is "not positive Robert Card is in this house," adding officials are "simply doing our due diligence." In Lisbon, investigators recovered a gun on Thursday while searching an abandoned car at a boat launch connected to the suspect, but it hasn’t been determined whether the firearm was used in Wednesday’s shooting rampage, a law enforcement source told CNN., Tommy Conrad, 34, was identified as one of the victims of the Lewiston, Maine, mass shootings, his family confirmed to CNN affiliate WMTW.  Conrad was the manager at the bowling alley, one of the two locations of last night's shooting rampage. He is survived by his nine-year-old daughter., Residents of Auburn should stay vigilant as the search for shooting suspect Robert Card continues, Mayor Jason Levesque said on Thursday.  “We are Mainers, stay vigilant, practice good situational awareness,” Levesque said. He said that the community is still in shock following the deadly shootings that took place in the neighboring town of Lewiston. The mayor highlighted the authorities and medics response to the shootings on Wednesday. “They all came in on-duty, off-duty,” Levesque said, “They rushed to the scene.”, Law enforcement officials returned to the Lewiston shooting suspect's last known address on Thursday evening, according to CNN teams on the scene. A spokesperson with the Maine Department of Public Safety, Shannon Moss, told CNN law enforcement is "not positive Robert Card is in this house," adding officials are "simply doing our due diligence."

The&nbsp;sources&nbsp;told CNN that&nbsp;once FBI SWAT&nbsp;teams cleared the house, investigators came in to execute the&nbsp;search&nbsp;warrant, looking for items like computers, notes, weapons and any evidence that&nbsp;might indicate a plan to carry out the&nbsp;shootings. CNN heard loud bangs near that address on Thursday, including someone shouting "FBI" through a bullhorn.  State and local investigators did a similar style entry and search at another location, as well as a search of Card's car on Thursday, the sources said. Similar searches of additional locations are expected in the coming days, the sources said., Multiple school districts and colleges in southern Maine announced they will be closed Friday as the search continues for the suspect in two shootings that left 18 people dead and 13 injured in Lewiston.

In remarks on the shooting Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre urged Congress to pass legislation to address the epidemic of gun violence.   She also cited a slew of executive orders President Joe Biden has signed as president to address gun violence, but acknowledged, “the president has been clear that executive action alone is just not enough.” Looking forward, Jean-Pierre said Biden “will continue to do everything in his power to protect the American people to protect our communities to protect our children, and we urge— we urge congressional Republicans to come to the table to come to the table if there truly is common ground at this time.” Jean-Pierre declined to say if Biden plans to visit Lewiston, Maine. She said it is a "dynamic situation on the ground" and that the administration's priority is "to make sure that Maine and local enforcement has the resources that it needs." She said Greg Jackson, the deputy director of the White House office of Gun Violence Prevention, convened federal agencies Thursday morning “to discuss federal resources already deployed and ensure readiness to meet any additional community needs as the people of Lewiston work through the unimaginable grief that they may be experiencing.”, Maine officials released a timeline of events surrounding Wednesday's deadly shooting rampage at two locations in Lewiston, Maine, which did not include police response time to the incidents. “That information will come out in an after-action review,” Maine Department of Public Safety Public Information Officer Shannon Moss explained, adding that law enforcement is focused on apprehending the suspect and an “after action review” was conducted after most “critical events.” Here's the timeline provided by the Maine Department of Public Safety: At 6:56 p.m., Wednesday, October 25, 2023: Auburn Communications Center was notified that a man walked into the Just-In-Time Recreation bowling alley on Mollison Street in Lewiston and began shooting.

Robert Card, 40, is being sought as a suspect, and police said he should be considered armed and dangerous. The attack appears to be the deadliest mass shooting of 2023, adding to a grim docket of 565 such incidents reported this year across the United States, with four or more shot excluding the shooter, according to the&nbsp;Gun Violence Archive. See photos below from the scene:, Tricia Asselin, 53, worked part-time at Just-In-Time Recreation in Lewiston, but was there bowling on Wednesday night when a gunman came in and opened fire, her brother told CNN Thursday.

He called Asselin his “baby sister” and said they were very close. He said her adult son is devastated by the loss. Asselin “was the rock of the family” and “kept everyone on an even keel," Johnson said. “If there was an argument going on, she would be the one to calm everyone down.

She said the administration will continue to provide support to local authorities as the investigation into the shootings uncovers what happened. An&nbsp;intensive manhunt is still underway&nbsp;for suspect Robert Card, 40, who&nbsp;faces an arrest warrant&nbsp;for eight counts of murder. Police said Card should be considered armed and dangerous, urging residents to shelter in place and report any suspicious activity to authorities. Harris noted that, in the United States,&nbsp;firearm deaths are the leading cause of death for children, warning, “Gun violence has terrorized and traumatized so many of our communities in this country.”&nbsp; Firearms accounted for nearly 19% of childhood deaths (ages 1-18) in 2021,&nbsp;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder database. “And let us be clear, it does not have to be this way — as our friends in Australia have demonstrated,” Harris added. Australia has long been referenced in the ongoing debate over how to stop mass shootings in the US. It passed nationwide gun control in 2006 after a lone gunman in Tasmania killed 20 people with his first 29 bullets, all in the span of 90 seconds. In a written statement later Thursday, Harris&nbsp;cited the newly-formed White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention as a way the Biden administration "will continue to work to save lives" until legislation is passed., On Friday, Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, was scheduled to host inauguration celebrations for its new president, Garry W.

Police are still searching for the suspect, Robert Card, 40, who is facing an arrest warrant for eight counts of murder, Maine State Police Col. William Ross said during a Thursday news conference. The suspect's brother, Ryan Card, said in a text message to CNN that the family has "helped law enforcement in anyway possible" and that they are urging Robert to turn himself in. He would not tell CNN if his brother has responded to the family’s requests.&nbsp; "The police have been given anything that we can offer to facilitate their efforts," he said, adding that “there are many people hurting out there, please focus on them … this is many people’s worst nightmare.”, The suspect in the Maine mass shooting is a skilled marksman and outdoorsman who was among the best shooters in his Army Reserve unit, a former colleague in the unit told CNN.&nbsp; Robert Card, who police are searching for in connection with the fatal shooting of at least 18 people in Lewiston, Maine, previously reported mental health issues and hearing voices and threatened to shoot up a National Guard base in the state, Maine law enforcement officials said.&nbsp;&nbsp; The officials also said Card was reported to have been committed to a mental health facility for two weeks over the summer.&nbsp; Card’s sister-in-law, Katie O’Neill, said in a brief conversation with CNN Thursday that Card does not have a long history of mental health struggles.&nbsp; “This is something that was an acute episode. This is not who he is,” O’Neill said. “He is not someone who has had mental health issues for his lifetime or anything like that.”&nbsp;&nbsp; The 40-year-old Card is a petroleum supply specialist in the Army Reserve and first enlisted in 2002, according to records provided by the Army on Thursday. He has no combat deployments, according to the records.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clifford Steeves of Massachusetts told CNN he knew Card when they served in the Army Reserve together, starting in the early 2000s until about a decade ago. He said he never witnessed any concerning behavior from Card.&nbsp; “He was a very nice guy — very quiet. He never overused his authority or was mean or rude to other soldiers,” Steeves said. “It’s really upsetting.”&nbsp; Steeves said the two served together around the country at different points, including in Wisconsin, Georgia and New York. He said he felt as though he “grew up” with Card because they entered the Army as young men and trained together.&nbsp;&nbsp; Steeves said that while “aggressive leadership was very prominent” in the Army, Card stuck out for being a “rational, understanding person” who “led through respect rather than fear.”&nbsp; Steeves said Card never saw combat but had extensive training, including firearms training and land navigation, “so he would be very comfortable in the woods.” He described Card as an “outdoors type of guy” and a skilled marksman who was one of the best shooters in his unit.&nbsp; Another former Army Reserve member who served with Card also described him as a “nice guy” who “never had an issue with anybody.” The servicemember, who asked to speak anonymously due to the sensitivity of the situation, did not recall Card showing any kind of violent behavior., GOP Sen.

The help included "approximately 100 team members" who were off-duty but came in to the hospital to help care for patients arriving from the scene of the shootings, Dr. John Alexander, the chief medical officer at Central Maine Medical Center, said in a news conference Thursday. The off-duty workers also helped treat people who were already in the hospital when it faced a sudden uptick in demand for trauma care. Nurses and physicians from other area hospitals joined the emergency response, along with ambulance services from other counties, Alexander said. At one point, Central Maine Medical Center had as many as 10 ambulance crews standing by outside the hospital's trauma center to ensure it could transfer any patients needed, according to Alexander. Nearby Boston and Dartmouth medical centers contributed extra helicopter services. "We were able to organize those resources and use them effectively," Alexander said of the sudden flood of support. CNN had reported Wednesday night that Central Maine Medical Center was calling in any available off-duty staff, according to Lewiston City Councilor Robert McCarthy., Two of Maine’s leading&nbsp;banks have shut down branches around Lewiston while a third has moved to shut down all branches throughout the state, as the manhunt for a mass shooter continues.

We will continue to be there every step of the way," he added. Noting that "countless" Americans have survived gun violence, he said it is "not normal, and we cannot accept it," adding that actions taken so far on gun safety are "simply not enough." "I urge Republican lawmakers in Congress to fulfill their duty to protect the American people. Work with us to pass a bill banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, to enact universal background checks, to require safe storage of guns, and end immunity from liability for gun manufacturers. This is the very least we owe every American who will now bear the scars — physical and mental — of this latest attack," Biden said., Robert Card, the suspect in Wednesday's shooting rampage, is facing eight counts of murder, Maine State Police Col.

The nonprofit and CNN define mass shootings as those in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter. Nearly 1 in 5 US adults have had a family member killed by a gun, including homicides and suicides, according to a 2023 survey from KFF (formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation). About the same proportion of adults have been personally threatened with a gun, and about 1 in 6 adults has witnessed an injury from a shooting, the survey found. More background: The FBI defines “mass murder” as the murder of four or more people and tracks “active shooter incidents,” but there is no federal or agreed-upon definition for a mass shooting. For all its data background, the Gun Violence Archive’s work is, at its heart, basic journalism. Researchers scrape data automatically from about 7,500 law enforcement agencies, media outlets and more organizations, the executive director Mark Bryant told CNN in 2022. They then comb through the results, double-check media sources, follow up with police, and add that information to the database. Most shootings are added to the system within about 72 hours, Bryant said. CNN's Annette Choi, Eric Levenson and Curt Merrill contributed reporting to this report., Residents of Bowdoin, Maine, were advised not to go outside early Thursday as the search continues for a person of interest in a deadly mass shooting in nearby Lewiston.

A father who rushed to be with his son at the mall described the horror that awaited him there.\nPolice killed the gunman: An officer was already at the mall for an unrelated call when the gunfire broke out, the Allen police chief said Saturday. The officer followed the sound of gunshots, tracked down the shooter and killed him, according to the chief.\nThe shooter's background: The gunman, who dressed in tactical gear, has been identified as 33-year-old Mauricio Garcia, a senior law enforcement source told CNN. Garcia had been living in some kind of temporary housing in the Dallas area, the source said. He used to work as a security guard and had received firearms training in that role, according to an official database.\nThe gunman's weapons: The shooter was armed with an&nbsp;AR-15 style rifle and had at least one other weapon on him when he was gunned down by police, a senior law enforcement source told CNN. Police also found multiple weapons in his car.\nPotential extremist ties: Authorities are investigating whether the shooter&nbsp;was motivated by right-wing extremism, a senior law enforcement source said. Authorities have not zeroed in on a specific motive, but the source said the shooter was found with an insignia on his clothing that read "RWDS" — an acronym known to watch groups — potentially standing for "Right Wing Death Squad." He also had an extensive social media presence that included neo-Nazi and White supremacist-related posts, according to the official.\nWhat we're still waiting for: More word directly from Texas officials. Authorities did not hold an official news conference Sunday, and have released little information about their investigation. The&nbsp;FBI&nbsp;told CNN Sunday the&nbsp;Texas Department of Public Safety is the lead agency in the mass shooting investigation., Editor’s Note:&nbsp;This post contains graphic descriptions of the shooting’s aftermath. A veteran and former police officer described the haunting scenes he found when he arrived at the outlet mall in Allen, Texas, Saturday. The aftermath of the mass shooting there was “horrific,” Steven Spainhouer told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield on Sunday. The former Army officer said he wouldn’t wish it upon anyone to see or experience what he did. Spainhouer said he was planning to meet his son, who works at the H&amp;M store at the outlet mall, for lunch. His son called to tell him about the active shooter and that he was sheltered in the break room at the store. Spainhouer drove to the outlet mall and said when he showed up, he saw many people fleeing the scene and counted seven bodies on the ground. He rushed up to different victims to check for a pulse, and said he witnessed one woman who had “nothing left of her face or head, it was gone.” Spainhouer performed chest compressions on another victim, who coughed up blood and then died, he told CNN. Then he saw a young child who crawled out from underneath one of the victims and was “caked with blood from head to toe,” Spainhouer said. The child kept saying that his mother was hurt. The father, who has personal and professional experience handling firearms, said the horror he found at the mall will repeat itself if lawmakers don't limit the access of certain weapons to the public. Spainhouer added that both he and his son will receive counseling for what they witnessed Saturday. Allen police subsequently disputed parts of Spainhouer's account, noting "inconsistencies" between his media interviews and the facts of the investigation. The department said it conducted a follow-up interview with Spainhouer and "determined that [he] is not a credible incident witness." According to the police department, Spainhouer did not perform CPR, and did not move a deceased mother who was covering a child who survived the shooting. In response, Spainhouer stood by his account, said he was "hurt and disappointed," and clarified that "a small child pulled himself from under a victim and I assisted him to a safe space away from the area." This article was updated on May 16 to reflect the Allen Police Department's statement disputing parts of Steven Spainhouer's eyewitness account — and Spainhouer's response to the police press release., Authorities are investigating whether the Allen, Texas, outlet mall shooter was motivated by right-wing extremism, a senior law enforcement source familiar with the investigation tells CNN. While the investigation remains ongoing and authorities have not zeroed in on a specific motive, the source said the deceased shooter was found with an insignia on his clothing that read "RWDS," which authorities believe may stand for "Right Wing Death Squad." As the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that monitors and reports on extremism, has noted in the past, some members of extremist groups have been seen in recent years with patches bearing the same letters. Investigators have also uncovered the gunman's extensive social media presence, the law enforcement source tells CNN. It includes neo-Nazi and White supremacist-related posts, and images that authorities believe he shared online, according to the official., A local mental health group is offering free counseling to the residents of Collin County, Texas, following Saturday’s shooting at a Dallas-area outlet mall. Lifepath Systems will offer free counseling to those affected by the shooting, working with law enforcement, the Texas Department of Public Safety, and Texas Health and Human Services, it said in a statement. Lifepath System works as a unit of local government and a not-for-profit center,&nbsp;according to its website., Mauricio Garcia — the 33-year-old who has been identified as the gunman in the Allen, Texas, outlet mall shooting, according to a senior law enforcement source —&nbsp;received firearms training for part of his work as a security officer, according to an official database. Garcia was approved to work as a commissioned security guard in Texas from April 2016 until April 2020, when his license expired, according to the Texas Online Private Security database, maintained by the Texas Department of Public Safety. His profile shows he worked for at least three security companies. None of those companies immediately responded to requests for comment.&nbsp; According to the database, Garcia received&nbsp;Level II&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;Level III&nbsp;security training. The former covers security laws in Texas; the latter, which is required for all commissioned security officers in Texas, includes firearm training and the demonstration of firearm proficiency, according to&nbsp;Jonah Nathan, vice president of Ranger Guard, a security guard service in Texas not affiliated with Garcia’s employers. In 2018,&nbsp;Garcia also completed a separate&nbsp;firearms proficiency&nbsp;training course, which requires six hours of continuing education, according to the Texas DPS database.&nbsp; Private security guards in Texas undergo background checks and are disqualified if they have committed certain crimes, such as assault, burglary or sexual offenses, among others, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety&nbsp;website&nbsp;and&nbsp;state codes. They are also disqualified if they have been dishonorably discharged from the US military; have been found incompetent by a court of law; or have been required to register as a sex offender.&nbsp;It’s unclear why Garcia’s license expired. A police officer killed the gunman outside the outlet mall after he carried out the massacre Saturday, according to the Allen police chief.

One patient is in fair condition while the other three are in critical condition, the Allen Police Department&nbsp;said.&nbsp; Allen Fire Chief Jonathan Boyd said Saturday that at least nine shooting victims went to area hospitals after the shooting, two of whom succumbed to their injuries. One wounded individual was transferred to&nbsp;Medical City Plano and is&nbsp;in fair condition, according to the Sunday release.&nbsp;Another individual was&nbsp;sent to Medical City Children’s Hospital and is in fair condition, the police department said. The age of the patient sent to&nbsp;Medical City Children’s Hospital has not been released, but officials have earlier said that the victims ranged in age from 5 to 61. The seventh surviving patient “was&nbsp;treated at a different area hospital," the release added.&nbsp;&nbsp; The shooting left at least eight people dead, according to local officials, and a police officer also killed the gunman outside the mall., The gunman in Saturday's mass shooting in Allen, Texas, has been identified as Mauricio Garcia, 33, a senior law enforcement source familiar with the investigation tells CNN's Josh Campbell.&nbsp; In addition to the AR-15 style weapon found near him, Garcia had at least one other weapon on him when he was fatally shot in front of the mall, the source tells CNN. Police also found multiple weapons in his car. CNN talked with neighbors who witnessed FBI and police at a home with an address matching that of Garcia's parents Saturday night. Authorities arrived there about an hour after the shooting and blocked off the street for several hours, neighbors told CNN's Ed Lavandera Garcia had been living in some form of temporary housing, according to the senior law enforcement source.&nbsp;The Dallas Morning News reports the suspect had been staying in an extended-stay hotel in Dallas., The gunman who killed eight people at an Allen, Texas, outlet mall used an AR-15 style weapon, President Joe Biden said in a statement Sunday. As previously reported, a photo from the scene obtained by CNN showed the suspected gunman dead on the ground near an AR-15 style rifle, armed with several extra magazines on his body., A Texas state senator whose district includes&nbsp;Uvalde&nbsp;blasted inaction on gun control by the state's Republican leadership in the wake of&nbsp;Saturday's mass shooting in Allen, calling it a “Texas nightmare.” "It's a nightmare that they created. It's a chaos that they created," Democratic state Sen. Roland Gutierrez told CNN’s Jake Tapper Sunday. On Saturday, Gutierrez had&nbsp;tweeted:&nbsp;“There is a special place in hell for people who watch all this happen and choose to do nothing,” along with the hashtag: “#bloodontheirhands.” Gutierrez has been&nbsp;outspoken&nbsp;in the wake of the deadly mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, which left 19 students and two teachers dead. CNN's Ed Lavandera,&nbsp;Elizabeth Wolfe&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sharif Paget contributed to this report., The FBI is asking witnesses who have digital evidence from Saturday's outlet mall shooting to submit information to an online portal created in the wake of the mass shooting.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Texas Department of Public Safety is the lead agency in the shooting investigation, the FBI told CNN Sunday. The bureau confirmed it "was present at two locations in Dallas," and is helping state and local police by "devoting all available resources to include investigative, intelligence, digital forensics, and victim services personnel among others." Allen is a suburb of Dallas located about 25 miles north of the city. Officials have released little information about their investigation into the massacre —&nbsp;including any potential motive. The shooting left at least eight people dead and seven more wounded., President Joe Biden again urged Congress to pass legislation banning assault weapons and enacting universal background checks in a statement reacting to the mass shooting&nbsp;in Allen, Texas. The president's statement also lists children among those killed. CNN has not independently confirmed whether&nbsp;children&nbsp;were among the dead,&nbsp;but CNN did report&nbsp;young children&nbsp;were being treated at the hospital. "Once again I ask Congress to send me a bill banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Enacting universal background checks. Requiring safe storage. Ending immunity for gun manufacturers. I will sign it immediately. We need nothing less to keep our streets safe," he added. Biden said yesterday's violence "is too shocking to be so familiar."&nbsp; He also said he is grateful for the first responders on the scene, and that he has directed federal agencies to provide support to local officials as needed.&nbsp; Biden ordered flags at the White House and other federal buildings to half-staff to honor the victims through May 11.&nbsp; News of the shooting emerged yesterday evening as Biden headed to church. As he left the church, he told reporters who asked about the shooting that he was "unaware" of the situation. The President was later briefed that night when he returned to the White House., Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas says he has spoken to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Allen Mayor Ken&nbsp;Fulk after Saturday's deadly shooting outside an outlet mall. Mayorkas declined to provide information about the shooter. “I think it's under investigation. The state and local authorities are leading that investigation,” he said., President Joe Biden has&nbsp;issued a proclamation honoring the victims of the mass shooting in Allen, Texas.

Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, told Fox News Sunday that authorities need to find answers on what exactly led up to the deadly mass shooting at an Allen, Texas, outlet mall yesterday.  "There’s always telltale signs before, there’s indicators should have looked out for," he said.  Cuellar added that strict gun control measures have not ended mass shootings in blue states around the country, arguing more needs to be done to get to the root of the issue.  Some context: The attack in Allen, Texas, is one of at least 199 mass shootings in the US this year, according to the&nbsp;Gun Violence Archive. The archive, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people have been wounded or killed, excluding a gunman. Texas has loosened restrictions on gun ownership in recent years amid several high-profile mass shootings that have devastated its communities. In 2021,&nbsp;legislation went into effect&nbsp;allowing most Texans who legally own a firearm to carry it openly in public without obtaining a permit or training. A&nbsp;2022 study&nbsp;found that states with weaker gun laws have higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides and suicides. Correction: An earlier version of this post misidentified Rep. Henry Cuellar's political party. He is a Democrat., All H&amp;M employees at the&nbsp;Allen Premium Outlets mall in Texas "are safe and accounted for," after Saturday's mass shooting, the company said in a statement to CNN Sunday. Witnesses told CNN’s Ed Lavandera that the shooter first opened fire near the popular clothing chain's store. Eight&nbsp;people were killed and at least seven others were injured when a gunman&nbsp;opened fire at the crowded mall&nbsp;Saturday afternoon, marking the latest act of gun violence to shatter an American community as they are enjoying activities in public places.

In her haste to get away, Blakey initially drove toward the sound of gunshots, before her daughter told her to turn around. But as she drove toward the exit, she said, they got stuck behind a scrum of other cars trying to do the same. That’s when she felt her car get hit twice by gunfire. The pair was able to get out of the parking lot and didn’t stop until they reached home, even when Blakey realized her car’s flat-tire warning light had come on. “We were on a mission to get out of there,” she said. The shooting was deeply disturbing, said Fatburger employee Tiffany Gipson, who told CNN she and other customers hid in a hallway behind their mall restaurant. “I’ve never witnessed anything like this.

CNN’s Josh Campbell, Ashley Killough, Keith Allen, Andy Rose, Paradise Afshar, John Miller, Phil Gast and Emma Tucker contributed to this report., Texas has loosened restrictions on gun ownership in recent years amid several high-profile mass shootings that have devastated its communities.

Scroll through these posts for the latest updates., A gunman is dead after killing at least 14 people and wounding many others in a shooting rampage Thursday at a central Prague university, according to Czech police. The attack at Charles University came after authorities received some prior warning about a student at the school, according to the country's head of police, though an investigation into key details of the shooting is just beginning. Here's what we know so far: The attack had a devastating toll: At least 14 people were killed and 25 others wounded, according to the latest update provided by police. Authorities revised the number of those killed and hurt in the attack as their investigation unfolded and victims received treatment at hospitals. At least 10 of those wounded are in serious condition, officials said. The victims were gunned down at Charles University, located in the busy tourist center of Prague.\nThe shooter is dead: Early reports indicate the shooter took his own life after the attack, but that is not yet confirmed, Czech Police President Martin Vondrášek said in a news conference. The shooter has not been formally identified because of the severity of his injuries, the police chief said, but investigators believe they know his identity. The suspect is a 24-year-old philosophy student at the school who had a gun permit and several weapons, Vondrášek said.\nPolice were tipped off about the suspect: Authorities received a tip saying the suspect was traveling from his hometown of Hostouň to Prague intending to take his own life, police said. Shortly after that, they learned that a man believed to be the suspect's father was found dead in Hostouň, which is about 100 miles from the Czech capital.\nOfficials had evacuated a different school building: Police were aware the suspected shooter had a lecture at 2 p.m. CET (8 a.m. ET) Thursday and had evacuated the building where the lecture was meant to take place, Vondrášek said. But then police received a call about a shooting in a different building on campus, according to the police chief.\nStudents scrambled to escape the gunfire: Police said it took time to help students safely evacuate after the shooting, as some had locked themselves in classrooms. A group of students climbed out of a classroom window and hid on the ledge of the university's Faculty of Arts building in an attempt to escape, a photo on social media showed.\nOfficials expressed shock at the violence: Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala expressed his condolences to the loved ones of the victims and said there was "absolutely no explanation, no justification" for the "senseless attack." He said it was believed to be an isolated incident and not an act of terror or attack by an organized group. Other European leaders also condemned the violence and expressed shock at the attack., The Czech Republic will observe a day of mourning Saturday for those killed in the Prague shooting, officials announced at a joint news conference Thursday. During the day of mourning, flags will be flown at half-staff and a minute of silence will be held nationwide. Bells across the country will toll for the victims of the attack, according to Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala., Graduate student Jakob Weizman, 25, told CNN he was in a classroom with his professor when they heard what sounded like gunshots and screams — and then the sounds grew louder.&nbsp; "My professor tried to lock the door, but it would not work," Weizman said. Luckily, Weizman managed to finally get the door locked, he said. Moments later, they started pushing classroom furniture up to the door to create a barricade. "About five minutes after that, someone tried to open the door very violently," Weizman said. He believes it may have been the shooter, but he does not know for sure. Weizman, who told CNN he lived in the United States for 15 years, never thought he would experience a mass shooting event in Europe.  "You think it will never happen," he said. "I'm still processing a lot." The graduate student said the police eventually arrived, so he broke down the barricade to let them in. Weizman said he could see blood on each floor as police escorted him down., Czech police chief Martin Vondrášek updated the number of people killed in a shooting at Charles University in central Prague, saying the 14 died and 25 others were injured.&nbsp; Vondrášek had previously said that at least 15 people had died.

The police chief updated the numbers while speaking at a press conference on Thursday evening., Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala expressed his condolences to the loved ones of the victims killed in a shooting at Charles University in Prague on Thursday. Addressing the nation, he said many young lives were lost in the “senseless attack."

He also assured people that there is no longer any danger.&nbsp; “Dear citizens, please let us think of all those who have lost their loved ones. This Christmas will be unimaginably sad for them. Let us share their sorrow and their pain. At this dark hour, we should come together and respect each other, to show our respect for the victims,” Fiala said., All events have been canceled at Charles University in Prague on Thursday and Friday as tighter security measures go into effect following a deadly shooting on its campus. At least 15 people were killed and dozens of others were wounded, according to Czech police. The university said it is also offering psychological help to those who need it.&nbsp; “We mourn the loss of life of members of our university community, express our deepest condolences to all the bereaved and our thoughts are with all those affected by the tragedy,” the university said., European leaders are condemning violence and expressing their shock after a shooter killed 15 people at a university in Prague on Thursday, saying they are sending condolences to those killed and injured.

Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen said in a post he is "deeply shocked by the cruel attack" in Prague and his thoughts are with those in the Czech Republic.

Law enforcement sources said a search of the suspect's last known address was conducted by FBI SWAT teams Thursday.\nRobert Card, 40, is facing an arrest warrant for eight counts of murder and should be considered armed and dangerous, police said. He is a certified firearms instructor and a member of the US Army Reserves, according to law enforcement.\nPolice are urging residents to shelter in place and report any suspicious activity to authorities. Lewiston is the state's second-largest city and is located about 36 miles north of Portland.\nThe rampage in Maine is the deadliest US mass shooting since&nbsp;the Uvalde school massacre. It adds to a grim docket of 565 such incidents, where four or more people are shot excluding the shooter, across the country this year, according to the&nbsp;Gun Violence Archive., Our live coverage of the hunt for the suspect in the Maine mass shooting has moved here, A shooting rampage in Lewiston, Maine, left 18 dead and 13 more injured Wednesday evening after a gunman opened fire on a bowling alley and a restaurant.  Lewiston is a sprawling residential and industrial area just off the Maine Turnpike and is home to two hospitals and the private liberal arts school Bates College. It’s a largely working-class community, with a median household income of about $48,000 and in which about 16% of the population lives in poverty, according to the&nbsp;US Census. Maine Gov. Janet Mills governor, who met her husband in Lewiston, described it as a “special place.” President Joe Biden has spoken by phone with Maine lawmakers and “offered full federal support in the wake of this horrific attack,” the White House said in a statement. Lewiston Mayor&nbsp;Carl Sheline is “heartbroken for our city and our people,” he said. “Lewiston is known for our strength and grit and we will need both in the days to come.” Lewiston Auburn Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce President Shanna Cox on Thursday called the scene of both attacks “family locations.” “It was family league activity at the bowling alley. The likeliness of this having direct impact for so many here is so real.” Auburn Mayor Jason Levesque lost friends in the shooting, he told “CNN This Morning.” A teenager who went to school with his son was shot and is expected to recover, he said. “There’s going to be very few people in this community that have not been touched by this,” he said. “It’s going to be with me for the rest of my life, and it’s really hard for me to explain that.” “The other folks that I knew that were there either as witnesses or family members of witnesses; it’s obviously traumatic,” Levesque said. “The bright spot was seeing individuals reunified with their loved ones after not knowing for so long, but on the on the other side, the ones that were waiting and waiting, probably would never be reunified.”, Peyton Brewer-Ross, 39, was participating in a cornhole tournament at Schemengees Bar and Grille when he was killed during Wednesday’s mass shooting in Lewiston, his brother Ralph Brewer told CNN.&nbsp; Brewer-Ross loved playing cornhole and enjoying hanging out with friends at Schemengees, his brother said. “It’s just surreal and sad. Now my brother is not here anymore along with 17 other people,” Brewer told CNN in a phone interview on Thursday. “He just went to play cornhole. He is the nicest person you would ever meet. He never had a bad thing to say about anyone.” Brewer-Ross “loved being a dad more than anything else,” his brother said. Two weeks ago, Brewer-Ross celebrated his daughter Elle's second birthday.&nbsp; In the past five years, Brewer-Ross worked his way through the iron pipefitter apprenticeship program and graduated last year. When he wasn’t spending time with his family, he enjoyed comics, cornhole, playing games and having fun with friends, his brother said.&nbsp; “We are walking around in a daze not knowing what to say, what to do, or how to act, because of a senseless shooting,” Brewer said. “It’s so unbelievable that this can continue to happen over and over again and nothing changes.”, The town of Lisbon, Maine, is asking residents to continue to shelter in place throughout the overnight hours as officials continue to search for the suspect in Wednesday night's deadly mass shooting. All Lisbon schools and town-owned buildings will be closed tomorrow, the update noted.&nbsp; Lisbon is about eight miles southeast of Lewiston, where the shooting rampage unfolded on Wednesday evening., Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) SWAT teams on Thursday conducted a search of the last known address associated with Robert Card, the suspect in a Wednesday night shooting rampage that left 18 people dead in Lewiston, law enforcement sources told CNN. The&nbsp;sources&nbsp;told CNN that&nbsp;once FBI SWAT&nbsp;teams cleared the house, investigators came in to execute the&nbsp;search&nbsp;warrant, looking for items like computers, notes, weapons and any evidence that&nbsp;might indicate a plan to carry out the&nbsp;shootings. Card, 40, is facing an arrest warrant for eight counts of murder and should be considered armed and dangerous, police said. State and local investigators did a similar style entry and search at another location, as well as a search of Card's car on Thursday, the sources told CNN. Law enforcement officials returned to the Lewiston shooting suspect's last known address on Thursday evening, according to CNN teams on site. At least five law enforcement vehicles, including an armored vehicle, were seen at the scene, CNN reported. A spokesperson with the Maine Department of Public Safety told CNN law enforcement is "not positive Robert Card is in this house," adding officials are "simply doing our due diligence." In Lisbon, investigators recovered a gun on Thursday while searching an abandoned car at a boat launch connected to the suspect, but it hasn’t been determined whether the firearm was used in Wednesday’s shooting rampage, a law enforcement source told CNN., Tommy Conrad, 34, was identified as one of the victims of the Lewiston, Maine, mass shootings, his family confirmed to CNN affiliate WMTW.  Conrad was the manager at the bowling alley, one of the two locations of last night's shooting rampage. He is survived by his nine-year-old daughter., Residents of Auburn should stay vigilant as the search for shooting suspect Robert Card continues, Mayor Jason Levesque said on Thursday.  “We are Mainers, stay vigilant, practice good situational awareness,” Levesque said. He said that the community is still in shock following the deadly shootings that took place in the neighboring town of Lewiston. The mayor highlighted the authorities and medics response to the shootings on Wednesday. “They all came in on-duty, off-duty,” Levesque said, “They rushed to the scene.”, Law enforcement officials returned to the Lewiston shooting suspect's last known address on Thursday evening, according to CNN teams on the scene. A spokesperson with the Maine Department of Public Safety, Shannon Moss, told CNN law enforcement is "not positive Robert Card is in this house," adding officials are "simply doing our due diligence."

The search was based on Card's association with the address in Bowdoin, Maine, the law enforcement sources said.  The&nbsp;sources&nbsp;told CNN that&nbsp;once FBI SWAT&nbsp;teams cleared the house, investigators came in to execute the&nbsp;search&nbsp;warrant, looking for items like computers, notes, weapons and any evidence that&nbsp;might indicate a plan to carry out the&nbsp;shootings. CNN heard loud bangs near that address on Thursday, including someone shouting "FBI" through a bullhorn.  State and local investigators did a similar style entry and search at another location, as well as a search of Card's car on Thursday, the sources said. Similar searches of additional locations are expected in the coming days, the sources said., Multiple school districts and colleges in southern Maine announced they will be closed Friday as the search continues for the suspect in two shootings that left 18 people dead and 13 injured in Lewiston.

Auburn and Brunswick Schools said they plan to resume classes on Monday but with a two-hour delay to the start of the school day. Central Maine Community College also shared on Facebook that it would remain closed on Friday., Maine Sen. Susan Collins called the day a mass shooting killed at least 18 people and injured 13 others in Lewiston a "dark day" for her state.  Speaking at a news conference with other state lawmakers on Thursday, Collins said the “heinous attack” is the worst mass shooting to happen in Maine. An extensive manhunt is underway for the suspect in the shooting. Various law enforcement officials are searching for Robert Card, 40, who is wanted for eight counts of murder, police said. At least 80 agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation are looking for Card, Collins said, in addition to personnel from various other agencies, including the ATF and the Coast Guard. “Everyone is determined to bring the killer to justice," she said. Speaking to the family of the victims, the Maine senator acknowledged that “no words can fully ease the shock, the pain and the justifiable anger that you are feeling.” Still, she said she hopes that they find strength in the support of people from around the country.  Watch:, Comedians John&nbsp;Mulaney&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pete Davidson&nbsp;have postponed two upcoming comedy shows in Maine following Wednesday’s&nbsp;mass shooting.

An&nbsp;intensive manhunt is still underway&nbsp;for suspect Robert Card, 40, who&nbsp;faces an arrest warrant&nbsp;for eight counts of murder. In remarks on the shooting Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre urged Congress to pass legislation to address the epidemic of gun violence.   She also cited a slew of executive orders President Joe Biden has signed as president to address gun violence, but acknowledged, “the president has been clear that executive action alone is just not enough.” Looking forward, Jean-Pierre said Biden “will continue to do everything in his power to protect the American people to protect our communities to protect our children, and we urge— we urge congressional Republicans to come to the table to come to the table if there truly is common ground at this time.” Jean-Pierre declined to say if Biden plans to visit Lewiston, Maine. She said it is a "dynamic situation on the ground" and that the administration's priority is "to make sure that Maine and local enforcement has the resources that it needs." She said Greg Jackson, the deputy director of the White House office of Gun Violence Prevention, convened federal agencies Thursday morning “to discuss federal resources already deployed and ensure readiness to meet any additional community needs as the people of Lewiston work through the unimaginable grief that they may be experiencing.”, Maine officials released a timeline of events surrounding Wednesday's deadly shooting rampage at two locations in Lewiston, Maine, which did not include police response time to the incidents. “That information will come out in an after-action review,” Maine Department of Public Safety Public Information Officer Shannon Moss explained, adding that law enforcement is focused on apprehending the suspect and an “after action review” was conducted after most “critical events.” Here's the timeline provided by the Maine Department of Public Safety: At 6:56 p.m., Wednesday, October 25, 2023: Auburn Communications Center was notified that a man walked into the Just-In-Time Recreation bowling alley on Mollison Street in Lewiston and began shooting.

Robert Card, 40, is being sought as a suspect, and police said he should be considered armed and dangerous. The attack appears to be the deadliest mass shooting of 2023, adding to a grim docket of 565 such incidents reported this year across the United States, with four or more shot excluding the shooter, according to the&nbsp;Gun Violence Archive. See photos below from the scene:, Tricia Asselin, 53, worked part-time at Just-In-Time Recreation in Lewiston, but was there bowling on Wednesday night when a gunman came in and opened fire, her brother told CNN Thursday. His other sister was also at the bowling alley but she was able to escape, he said. Johnson spoke to CNN while on a flight to Maine to identify his sister and be with the rest of their family. He called Asselin his “baby sister” and said they were very close. He said her adult son is devastated by the loss. Asselin “was the rock of the family” and “kept everyone on an even keel," Johnson said. “If there was an argument going on, she would be the one to calm everyone down. If somebody was having a bad day, she would be right on the phone to talk to you about it,” he said., A patient that was transferred from Central Maine Medical Center (CMMC) to Maine Medical Center (MMC) after Wednesday’s shooting rampage has been discharged, a statement from MaineHealth said. “On Oct. 25, Central Maine Medical Center (CMMC) transferred one patient injured in the Lewiston shootings to Maine Medical Center (MMC).

She said the administration will continue to provide support to local authorities as the investigation into the shootings uncovers what happened. An&nbsp;intensive manhunt is still underway&nbsp;for suspect Robert Card, 40, who&nbsp;faces an arrest warrant&nbsp;for eight counts of murder. Police said Card should be considered armed and dangerous, urging residents to shelter in place and report any suspicious activity to authorities. Harris noted that, in the United States,&nbsp;firearm deaths are the leading cause of death for children, warning, “Gun violence has terrorized and traumatized so many of our communities in this country.”&nbsp; Firearms accounted for nearly 19% of childhood deaths (ages 1-18) in 2021,&nbsp;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder database. “And let us be clear, it does not have to be this way — as our friends in Australia have demonstrated,” Harris added. Australia has long been referenced in the ongoing debate over how to stop mass shootings in the US. It passed nationwide gun control in 2006 after a lone gunman in Tasmania killed 20 people with his first 29 bullets, all in the span of 90 seconds. In a written statement later Thursday, Harris&nbsp;cited the newly-formed White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention as a way the Biden administration "will continue to work to save lives" until legislation is passed., On Friday, Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, was scheduled to host inauguration celebrations for its new president, Garry W.

Police are still searching for the suspect, Robert Card, 40, who is facing an arrest warrant for eight counts of murder, Maine State Police Col. William Ross said during a Thursday news conference. The suspect's brother, Ryan Card, said in a text message to CNN that the family has "helped law enforcement in anyway possible" and that they are urging Robert to turn himself in. He would not tell CNN if his brother has responded to the family’s requests.&nbsp; "The police have been given anything that we can offer to facilitate their efforts," he said, adding that “there are many people hurting out there, please focus on them … this is many people’s worst nightmare.”, The suspect in the Maine mass shooting is a skilled marksman and outdoorsman who was among the best shooters in his Army Reserve unit, a former colleague in the unit told CNN.&nbsp; Robert Card, who police are searching for in connection with the fatal shooting of at least 18 people in Lewiston, Maine, previously reported mental health issues and hearing voices and threatened to shoot up a National Guard base in the state, Maine law enforcement officials said.&nbsp;&nbsp; The officials also said Card was reported to have been committed to a mental health facility for two weeks over the summer.&nbsp; Card’s sister-in-law, Katie O’Neill, said in a brief conversation with CNN Thursday that Card does not have a long history of mental health struggles.&nbsp; “This is something that was an acute episode. This is not who he is,” O’Neill said. “He is not someone who has had mental health issues for his lifetime or anything like that.”&nbsp;&nbsp; The 40-year-old Card is a petroleum supply specialist in the Army Reserve and first enlisted in 2002, according to records provided by the Army on Thursday. He has no combat deployments, according to the records.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clifford Steeves of Massachusetts told CNN he knew Card when they served in the Army Reserve together, starting in the early 2000s until about a decade ago. He said he never witnessed any concerning behavior from Card.&nbsp; “He was a very nice guy — very quiet. He never overused his authority or was mean or rude to other soldiers,” Steeves said. “It’s really upsetting.”&nbsp; Steeves said the two served together around the country at different points, including in Wisconsin, Georgia and New York. He said he felt as though he “grew up” with Card because they entered the Army as young men and trained together.&nbsp;&nbsp; Steeves said that while “aggressive leadership was very prominent” in the Army, Card stuck out for being a “rational, understanding person” who “led through respect rather than fear.”&nbsp; Steeves said Card never saw combat but had extensive training, including firearms training and land navigation, “so he would be very comfortable in the woods.” He described Card as an “outdoors type of guy” and a skilled marksman who was one of the best shooters in his unit.&nbsp; Another former Army Reserve member who served with Card also described him as a “nice guy” who “never had an issue with anybody.” The servicemember, who asked to speak anonymously due to the sensitivity of the situation, did not recall Card showing any kind of violent behavior., GOP Sen.

Collins added that Maine is "very grateful" for the help from the federal government, and noted that Tom Perez, a senior adviser to Biden and former Democratic National Committee chair, has been in constant contact with her.

The help included "approximately 100 team members" who were off-duty but came in to the hospital to help care for patients arriving from the scene of the shootings, Dr. John Alexander, the chief medical officer at Central Maine Medical Center, said in a news conference Thursday. The off-duty workers also helped treat people who were already in the hospital when it faced a sudden uptick in demand for trauma care. Nurses and physicians from other area hospitals joined the emergency response, along with ambulance services from other counties, Alexander said. At one point, Central Maine Medical Center had as many as 10 ambulance crews standing by outside the hospital's trauma center to ensure it could transfer any patients needed, according to Alexander. Nearby Boston and Dartmouth medical centers contributed extra helicopter services. "We were able to organize those resources and use them effectively," Alexander said of the sudden flood of support. CNN had reported Wednesday night that Central Maine Medical Center was calling in any available off-duty staff, according to Lewiston City Councilor Robert McCarthy., Two of Maine’s leading&nbsp;banks have shut down branches around Lewiston while a third has moved to shut down all branches throughout the state, as the manhunt for a mass shooter continues.

We will continue to be there every step of the way," he added. Noting that "countless" Americans have survived gun violence, he said it is "not normal, and we cannot accept it," adding that actions taken so far on gun safety are "simply not enough." "I urge Republican lawmakers in Congress to fulfill their duty to protect the American people. Work with us to pass a bill banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, to enact universal background checks, to require safe storage of guns, and end immunity from liability for gun manufacturers. This is the very least we owe every American who will now bear the scars — physical and mental — of this latest attack," Biden said., Robert Card, the suspect in Wednesday's shooting rampage, is facing eight counts of murder, Maine State Police Col.

The nonprofit and CNN define mass shootings as those in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter. Nearly 1 in 5 US adults have had a family member killed by a gun, including homicides and suicides, according to a 2023 survey from KFF (formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation). About the same proportion of adults have been personally threatened with a gun, and about 1 in 6 adults has witnessed an injury from a shooting, the survey found. More background: The FBI defines “mass murder” as the murder of four or more people and tracks “active shooter incidents,” but there is no federal or agreed-upon definition for a mass shooting. For all its data background, the Gun Violence Archive’s work is, at its heart, basic journalism. Researchers scrape data automatically from about 7,500 law enforcement agencies, media outlets and more organizations, the executive director Mark Bryant told CNN in 2022. They then comb through the results, double-check media sources, follow up with police, and add that information to the database. Most shootings are added to the system within about 72 hours, Bryant said. CNN's Annette Choi, Eric Levenson and Curt Merrill contributed reporting to this report., Residents of Bowdoin, Maine, were advised not to go outside early Thursday as the search continues for a person of interest in a deadly mass shooting in nearby Lewiston.

shooting at a private Christian elementary school in Nashville, Tennessee, police said.\nTwo of the victims were school employees. One was the head of the school and the other a custodian, according to the school. \nThe shooter, a 28-year-old Nashville resident police say was once a student at the school, was killed during gunfire with police, authorities said. \nThe attack, which police said was a targeted one and&nbsp;involved prior planning, was the deadliest US school shooting in nearly a year. The shooter had drawn detailed maps of the school, police said, including the entry points to the building. Police have also located&nbsp;writings from the shooter that they are reviewing., Our live coverage of the Nashville school shooting has moved here., Park Cities Presbyterian Church in Dallas&nbsp;released a statement Monday confirming that their former pastor, Chad Scruggs, lost his daughter Hallie in Monday’s shooting at the Covenant School. CNN had reported that Hallie Scruggs was among the three 9-year-old students shot and killed in the shooting.  Here is the church's statement:, In messages shared with CNN affiliate WTVF, a former middle school basketball teammate of Audrey Hale provides chilling new details regarding an exchange she had on social media with the shooter prior to yesterday's school shooting in Nashville.&nbsp; Averianna Patton said she saw a message on her phone that Hale had sent to her on Instagram Monday morning that stated Hale was planning to die by suicide and that she would see it on the news.&nbsp;A screenshot of a message published by WTVF appeared to show that the message was sent at 9:57 a.m. local time. "One day this will make more sense," Hale wrote. "I've left behind more than enough evidence behind. But something bad is about to happen," the message stated.&nbsp; "I tried to comfort and encourage her and subsequently reached out to the Suicide Prevention Help Line after being instructed to by my father at 10:08 am," Patton said.&nbsp; Patton tells WTVF that she she called the Nashville Davidson County Sheriff's Office at 10:13 a.m. to make them aware of the situation and was instructed to call Nashville's non-emergency number.&nbsp; "I called Nashville's non-emergency line at 10:14 a.m. and was on hold for nearly seven minutes before speaking with someone who said that they would send an officer to my home. An officer did not come to my home until 3:29 p.m.," Patton said. Don Aaron, spokesperson for the Metro Nashville Police Department, said during a news conference that the first calls of an active shooting came in at around 10:15 a.m. local time. When officers arrived, they went through the first level of the building, he said. They then heard gunshots coming from the second level of the building, according to Aaron. He said that's where police confronted and killed the shooter at 10:27 a.m. local time., Police in Nashville are still digging into the background and motivations of a former student who entered a Christian elementary school armed with AR-style weapons and detailed maps and opened fire,&nbsp;killing three children and three adults. If you are just reading in, here's the latest on the shooting and investigation:  The shooter: The person was identified as 28-year-old Audrey Hale. Hale was shot and killed by police during the Monday attack, and left behind “drawn out” maps of the Covenant School detailing “how this was all going to take place,” Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake said. As police work to piece together what led up to the violence, officials said they had determined where the shooter lived in the Nashville area and have interviewed Hale’s father.&nbsp; Hale, who attended the Christian school years ago, left writings that pertain to the shooting and had scouted a second possible attack location in Nashville, “but because of a threat assessment by the suspect – there’s too much security – they decided not to,” police chief said.The writings revealed that the attack at Covenant School “was calculated and planned,” Metro Nashville said. So far, little is known about the shooter. Hale graduated from Nossi College of Art &amp; Design in Nashville last year, the president of the school confirmed to CNN, and a LinkedIn profile says Hale worked as a freelance graphic designer and a part-time grocery shopper. Police have referred to Hale as the “female shooter” and at an evening press conference added that Hale was transgender. When asked for clarification, a spokesperson told CNN Hale used “male pronouns” on a social media profile. The weapons: The shooter was “someone that had multiple rounds of ammunition, prepared for confrontation with law enforcement, prepared to do more harm than was actually done,” the police chief said in a news conference. Three weapons – an AR-style rifle, an AR-style pistol and a handgun – were found and police believe Hale obtained at least two of the weapons legally, Drake said. A search warrant executed at Hale’s home also resulted in the seizure of a sawed-off shotgun, a second shotgun and other evidence, according to police. The victims: All three students shot and killed were 9 years old. They were identified as Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney. Three adults killed in the shooting were identified as 61-year-old Cynthia Peak, 60-year-old Katherine Koonce and 61-year-old Mike Hill, police said. Two Covenant School employees are among the victims of Monday’s mass shooting, according to the school. What is expected to happen today: Investigators were expected to spend Tuesday processing the scene and gathering more details about what happened during the roughly 14 minutes of terror at the elementary school. Mass shootings in America: The attack marked the 19th shooting at a school or university so far in 2023 in which at least one person was wounded, according to a CNN tally. With six victims, the shooting at Covenant is the deadliest school shooting since the attack in Uvalde, Texas, last May left 21 people dead. Read more about the shooting here., Kris Brown, the president of Brady: United Against Gun Violence, said the solutions to stopping mass shootings "are before us and they have been for a long time" but it will take voters to make the change.  Brady is a US nonprofit that advocates for gun control and against gun violence.  "It takes all of us. This isn't just on the kids. This is on adults," Brown added. "This is on their grandparents. This is on us and we can make a difference, but we have to make it an absolute priority and then hold elected officials to&nbsp;account when they do not vote 'yes' on bills to advance lifesaving measures.", A more heartrending and quintessentially&nbsp;American scene&nbsp;is hard to imagine. A human chain of children, hand-in-hand, shepherded by police officers, fled the latest school struck by unfathomable tragedy. On Monday, it was&nbsp;Nashville’s turn&nbsp;to join the roster of cities made notorious by a mass shooting epidemic much of the country seems prepared to tacitly accept as the price of the right to own high-powered firearms.&nbsp; The reality of what unfolded inside was inhuman, but it can unfortunately be imagined given the gruesome insider accounts that emerged from previous school shootings — in&nbsp;Uvalde, Texas,&nbsp;last year, or at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut in 2012. Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney, all 9 years old, were gunned down by a shooter armed with two AR-style weapons and a handgun, two of which police said were bought legally. Their names — known only to the rest of America in death — were released by police about the same time as they should have been going home from Covenant School for the day. Three staff, all half a century older, also died. They were Cynthia Peak, 61, Katherine Koonce, 60, and Mike Hill, 61. They were all murdered in the place that should be the safest: where kids go to school. But a plague of recent classroom rampages, distinguished even among America’s gun violence by their depravity, shows that nowhere is really secure.

Her other son, Aldane Brooks, was placed on lockdown at a nearby high school on Monday when the shooting occurred at&nbsp;Covenant School. “We didn’t know if we were safe,” Aldane Brooks told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “We didn’t know if someone was coming to kill us or not.” Brooks added that she wanted to race to her son's school the moment she heard news of a shooting, but he told her to wait as they had no information as to what was going on. “We’re not safe anywhere,” Brooks said, “We’re not safe in schools, we’re not safe when we go out to eat, we’re not safe in church, we’re not safe at the Waffle House.” Brooks said she thinks about mass shootings every time she drops her son off at school. The mother and son addressed families of the victims of Monday’s shooting saying they “understand this feeling first hand.” “The pain will forever be there, but you’re not alone,” Aldane Brooks said., In a&nbsp;tweet, Metro Nashville Police shared a photo of the car driven by Covenant School shooter Audrey Hale as well as the doors that the shooter shot out to gain entry into the school. Inside the vehicle, additional material written by the shooter was found, the tweet said. “Active shooter Audrey Elizabeth Hale, 28, drove this Honda Fit to the Covenant Church/school campus this morning and parked.

Ashbey Beasley told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday evening that she was visiting her sister-in-law in Nashville and was set to have lunch with a friend when she heard about the shooting. Following the Highland Park shooting, Beasley has joined a gun violence prevention group and dedicated her life to making a change with gun laws. “It’s the access to guns that is killing us,” Beasley said, “We’re not going to see any change until our lawmakers step up and pass gun safety legislation,” “Unfortunately that’s where we’re at, we have to take care of each other, survivors have to take care of each other,” Beasley said. Beasley&nbsp;jumped in a news conference&nbsp;earlier Monday, following the Nashville shooting, to protest against gun violence. Former president Barack Obama&nbsp;took to Twitter&nbsp;to share the video of Beasley during that news conference saying, “We are failing our children. Guns are now the leading cause of death for children in the U.S. Michelle and I mourn with the students and families of the Covenant School today.”, The shooter who killed six people at Covenant School in Nashville Monday may have resented having to attend the school in the past, according to Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake.

Still, Jean-Pierre said Biden would continue to call on Congress to take action, adding Biden “has done almost as much as he can from the federal level to show how important this is to him.”, The&nbsp;Nashville Fire Department&nbsp;tried to provide life-saving efforts during&nbsp;Monday's shooting incident at&nbsp;Covenant School, Covenant Presbyterian Church, authorities said Monday during a news&nbsp;conference.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our&nbsp;crews&nbsp;were&nbsp;able&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;scene&nbsp;to&nbsp;pull&nbsp;out&nbsp;those&nbsp;that&nbsp;had&nbsp;viable&nbsp;signs&nbsp;of&nbsp;life.&nbsp;Those that&nbsp;were&nbsp;still&nbsp;showing&nbsp;the&nbsp;option&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;saved," Nashville Fire Department's&nbsp;Kendra Loney said.&nbsp;&nbsp; A reunification site was set up soon after with "mental&nbsp;health&nbsp;specialists&nbsp;and&nbsp;professionals" for the families and students,&nbsp;Loney added.&nbsp;&nbsp; On a typical day, there's about 200&nbsp;students&nbsp;and about 40 to 50 staff members inside the school,&nbsp;Don Aaron with the&nbsp;Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said.

Hammond, CNN, A shooting that killed a local DJ and injured more than 20 others, including children, at the end of the&nbsp;Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl victory rally on Wednesday appears to have stemmed from a dispute between several people, according to the city's police chief. \nAuthorities say two juveniles remain in custody while police investigate the violence that overshadowed the celebration. A third person, an adult, was released Thursday after officials deemed them uninvolved in the shooting.\nAbout a million fans were in downtown Kansas City for the parade, and players were still on the stage of the victory rally when the shooting took place.\nThe shooting was at least the 48th mass shooting in the United States this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.  We've wrapped up our live coverage for the evening. You can learn more about the investigation by scrolling through the posts in this feed., Police are investigating a shooting that killed one person and wounded more than 20 others on Wednesday. The shooting happened after a rally celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl win. Here's what we know so far: Victims: The woman killed has been identified as Lisa Lopez-Galvan, a local DJ and a mom of two kids, according to her family and police. More than 20 others were hurt, ranging from 8 to 47 years old, according to Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves. Half of those people were under the age of 16, she added. A majority of the patients admitted to University Health Truman Medical Center and Children's Mercy Kansas City have been discharged, hospital officials.\nWhat happened: The shooting was a personal dispute between "several people" in which others were wounded, Graves said. She said there was no link to terrorism or homegrown extremism.\nNo one charged: Initially, police detained three people for further investigation — one adult and two juveniles, according to Graves. The adult was released Thursday afternoon after police determined they were not involved, a spokesperson for the police department said. Two juveniles still in custody have not yet been charged, but police are working with juvenile prosecutors to "review investigative findings," officials added.\nOngoing investigation: Bullets and shell casings left behind at the scene of the shooting are key pieces of evidence being analyzed to determine a possible connection to the people in police custody as well as any other possible suspects, a law enforcement source told CNN. Police said they recovered an unspecified number of guns. ATF investigators will also look at whether the bullets or shell casings match any of those firearms or any weapons in databases, according to the source.\nWitness accounts: One man said he overheard an altercation before the shooting where a woman told a presumed shooter, "Don’t do it, not here; this is stupid." He said the person pulled out a gun and "started shooting and spinning in a circle," Jacob Gooch, Sr. told CBS' Gayle King. Kansas&nbsp;City Chiefs offensive lineman Trey Smith told ABC he found shelter in a closet and guided others to safety. He also helped calm scared kids, as did cornerback L'Jarius Sneed., One of the three people detained in the wake of Wednesday’s Super Bowl celebration shooting has been released, the Kansas City Police Department said. That person was determined not to have been involved, a police spokesperson tells CNN.&nbsp; Only two juvenile teens are currently in custody in connection with the incident, according to the police department. "A third person who was in custody was determined to not be involved," spokesperson Alayna Gonzalez said. "The two juveniles are currently being held in custody while we work with juvenile prosecutors to review investigative findings and determine applicable charges," the spokesperson added. "The juvenile court system determines the custody status of all juvenile arrests.", Kansas City Chiefs cornerback L'Jarius Sneed said the shooting after Super Bowl celebrations on Wednesday brought back memories of being a target of gun violence. Sneed said he and others rushed into a building when the chaos started. The four-year NFL pro said kids "surrounded me" while seeking shelter in a basement.&nbsp; "I tried to comfort them in that situation. Just tell them everything is OK. Just rubbing their back(s) and just be like, 'Everything’s going to be fine,'" he said. "It's very sad," he told ESPN. "Just for the kids. They are trying to celebrate something, a big accomplishment for us. We were just trying to celebrate it with them, and for that to happen is very tragic.", A majority of the patients admitted to University Health Truman Medical Center and Children's Mercy Kansas City have been discharged, hospital officials confirmed Thursday afternoon.&nbsp; At University Health Truman Medical Center, eight of the 12 patients have been released. Of the four still being treated, three suffered gunshot wounds and one sustained a broken bone while trying to flee the scene, according to doctors. Two of the gunshot victims are in critical condition in the hospital’s intensive care unit, Dr. Dustin Neel said. He called one a “young gentleman” and the other an “older woman,” and said they were the first two patients the hospital received.&nbsp; Children’s Mercy Kansas City said they initially admitted 12 people after the shooting — 11 children and one adult. Nine of the children had gunshot wounds. All but three patients have been discharged as of Thursday, hospital officials said. Those three still in the hospital are children, Chief Nursing Officer Stephanie Meyer said. She said they have been stabilized and all are doing well and expected to make full recoveries., Radio traffic between law enforcement and other emergency responders details the response to Wednesday’s shooting at the&nbsp;Chiefs&nbsp;victory rally at Union Station in Kansas City. In the Broadcastify&nbsp;channel Kansas City Metro Area Fire, EMS, and Police, authorities can be heard working to get medical personnel to wounded victims and coordinate the search for suspects. “Fire’s getting reports of shots fired at (unintelligible) and Main … there’s a bunch of people running, can we get more people down here?" one person said. On the radio, responders are heard reporting a shooting on the west side of Union Station and dispatching emergency medics. Later, officers take one person into custody and start to try to clear the crowd out., President Joe Biden is devastated but “also frustrated”&nbsp;by Wednesday’s mass shooting in Kansas City that killed one person and injured more than 20 others, the White House said Thursday. In a statement lamenting the shooting Wednesday, Biden mourned that the celebration “turned to tragedy,” before calling on Congress to pass an assault weapons ban, limit high-capacity magazines and strengthen background checks. The press secretary wouldn’t say if Biden plans to speak to the victims or travel to Kansas City., The family of the woman killed in a shooting after a Super Bowl celebration for the Kansas City Chiefs is remembering her as an amazing mother, wife and daughter. Radio&nbsp;DJ Lisa Lopez-Galvan&nbsp;died after getting shot&nbsp;at&nbsp;the rally, her family and her employer KKFI 90.1 FM have said, and police confirmed her death on Thursday.  "We are heartbroken with the loss of our loved one, Elizabeth 'Lisa,'" her family said in a statement, adding that she leaves behind her husband and two kids. CNN's Chris Boyette contributed reporting to this post., Bullets and shell casings left behind at the scene of Wednesday's shooting after the Chiefs Super Bowl rally in Kansas City, Missouri, are key pieces of evidence being analyzed to determine a possible connection to individuals currently in custody — as well as any possible additional suspects — a law enforcement source told CNN.&nbsp; Specialists from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) are also analyzing bullets recovered at the scene and in victims to determine which gun was responsible for killing or injuring specific people, the source said.&nbsp; Ejected casings are additionally being studied to identify whether unique markings left behind on a shell casing by a gun during firing — similar to a fingerprint — match other shootings in law enforcement databases, the source said.&nbsp; On Wednesday, Kansas City police said three people had been detained, and an unspecified number of guns were recovered by police. In addition to helping tie those guns to rounds fired at the scene, the source said ATF investigators are working to determine whether any bullets and shell casings recovered fail to fit the unique profile of those recovered weapons, which could indicate additional suspects are at large., Half of the over 20 people injured in the shooting at the end of the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl victory rally are under the age of 16, Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said. The victims range in age from 8 to 47 years old, according to Graves. The one person who has died from the shooting was 43 years old, she confirmed. CNN&nbsp;previously reported that Lisa Lopez-Galvan, a&nbsp;Kansas&nbsp;City-area radio DJ, died during the shooting and was identified by KKFI radio 90.1 FM.  There were 22 victims of the shooting who were treated at the scene and transported by emergency personnel, said Kansas City Interim Fire Chief Ross Grundyson on Thursday. Of those taken to hospitals, there were eight critical patients in critical condition, seven in serious condition and six with minor injuries. He said all the critical patients were transported off the scene within 10 minutes of first responders’ arrival. The number treated and transported by first responders may not include everyone who was injured, as some victims may have sought treatment on their own after fleeing the scene., Free counseling services are now available to anyone in the Kansas City community after a shooting after the Chiefs Super Bowl parade on Wednesday, according to the Jackson County prosecutor's office. Counselors and social workers will be available at the United Church of Christ in Brookside from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. local time on Thursday, according to the office, and the services are free. The Child Protection Center will also have resources there, it said. Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas also said people can call "988" to be connected with services. Victim advocacy information will also be available soon, he said at a news conference Thursday., When asked if Kansas City would hold another parade for any future championships by the Chiefs, Mayor Quinton Lucas said Thursday that the city is not done hosting parades. "We have a plan for a St. Patrick’s Day parade in Kansas City. We have parades all the time. I don’t think they’ll end," he said. "Certainly we recognize the public safety challenges at issue that relate to them." "We’ve had parades like this before," he said. "We had one last year without this type of incident. We had a Kansas City Royals parade where we had almost no arrests in 2015. So I don’t think in anyway that this is Kansas City. I do think there is a gun violence challenge in this community and many others.", Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said the investigation into the deadly shooting following the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl victory rally remains ongoing and the department has yet to charge the individuals involved in the incident.  “We have not charged them yet; this is still under investigation,” Graves said at a news conference Thursday.  Two of the detained are juveniles, according to the police chief.  A law enforcement official told CNN the three people in custody are all believed to have been involved in a personal dispute and that, initially, 10 people were questioned.

Throughout the day, officials were being called to various locations for what police described as apparently legitimate sightings of the suspect. An undercover officer saw and confronted the gunman, then backup was called, police said.

He was a former Coast Guardsman and was discharged from active duty in January of this year. Patterson had minimal contact with the police department before the shooting., Deion Patterson, the Midtown Atlanta shooting suspect, was captured inside a gated condominium complex in Cobb County on Wednesday night, about 11 miles north of the shooting scene, local residents told CNN. Christy Colwell, who lives at Waterford Place, said dogs barking within the complex made her concerned the fugitive might be hiding in the pool area, which includes a gazebo.

Sen. Jon Ossoff released a statement Wednesday decrying gun violence.  "The level of gun violence in America today is unconscionable and unacceptable, and policy makers at all levels have a responsibility to ensure public safety and implement long-overdue reforms," the Democratic senator said    Gov.

Dickens, speaking at a news conference to announce the arrest of a suspect in the shooting, called for universal background checks, better red-flag laws to allow judges to remove guns from people who pose risks – and more action to make sure "those who shouldn't have guns don't have them." The mayor thanked Grady Memorial Hospital and the authorities involved in the investigation and offered prayers to the victims and their families., Authorities late Wednesday described the chaotic manhunt that led to the apprehension of Deion Patterson, the suspect in the mass shooting at an Atlanta medical facility.  Patterson was arrested in Cobb County, near the Truist Park baseball stadium. He commandeered a pickup truck near the scene of the shooting, according to police. And the plate of the truck was detected by a license plate reader in Cobb County, which is northwest of downtown Atlanta, they said. VanHoozer said officials were being called to various locations throughout Cobb County for what he described as apparently legitimate sightings of Patterson, as he was still at large.

Powell, Maureen Chowdhury and Elise Hammond, CNN, Louisville police have released bodycam footage showing the tense police confrontation with the gunman who shot multiple people at a bank on Monday, leaving at least five dead.\nThe&nbsp;mass shooter, who was killed by police, legally bought an AR-15-style rifle at a local gun dealership, the interim Louisville Metro Police chief said.\nIt’s still not clear what provoked the 25-year-old employee&nbsp;to go on a deadly rampage at Old National Bank and livestream the gruesome attack.\nThe AR-15 and its offshoots have been used in several recent mass shootings,&nbsp;including the Nashville shooting just two weeks ago. Editor's note:&nbsp;This story contains graphic video and descriptions of violence., Our live coverage of the Louisville bank shooting has moved here., The Louisville Metro Police Department released several minutes of officer body camera footage showing the tense moments between police officers and the gunman outside the Monday bank shooting. Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey walked through several clips of the incident Tuesday evening. Police said it took about three minutes for the nearest responding officers to arrive. Here's what to know: Officer Cory "CJ" Galloway: The gunman in Monday's shooting appeared to be waiting for police officers to arrive, Humphrey said. He said the shooter went to the bank's front lobby "after assaulting the victims in the office area." Footage from Galloway's body camera shows police talking about how they can’t see the shooter and that he is shooting through windows. “Shooter has an angle on that officer!” one officer can be heard saying. “We got to get up there!” he adds.&nbsp;Galloway was Wilt's training officer, according to Humphrey.\nOfficer Nickolas Wilt: The newly sworn-in officer was shown in body camera footage going back into the line of fire to protect other people, Humphrey said. He said since he was new, he was acting based on "his training and his character" and that he "never hesitates." Wilt was shot in the head and is still in critical condition at the hospital, officials said. \nWhat happened next: While police attempted to rescue Wilt after he was shot, Galloway's body camera shows the suspect shooting at them "trying to kill them in their process of trying to save Officer Wilt,” Humphrey said. The gunfire broke the bank windows, allowing Galloway to find a vantage point to see where the gunman was located, Humphrey said. This is when Galloway kills the shooter, the deputy chief said. Galloway suffered a minor gunshot wound.\nBystander video: Another video showed a recording taken by someone in a building across the street. You can see an officer outside the bank.\nBefore police arrived: In addition to the surveillance footage, CNN reported that the shooter, identified as a 25-year-old bank employee,&nbsp;live-streamed the attack&nbsp;on Instagram. The video has been taken down. A city official described the footage to CNN, saying the shooter fired his AR-15-style weapon inside the bank for about a minute and then appeared to wait a minute and a half before police arrived., Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said he is already talking with state lawmakers from both parties about gun reform, one day after a mass shooting at a bank killed five people in his city. Greenberg, who knew one person that was killed, told CNN the victims "should not be dead," as in the case of other people killed by gun violence. While there is a spirit of coming together, he said, “I'm also hopeful we are taking action.” “We have had enough gun violence in Louisville. We have had enough gun violence in our country and it’s time to take action,” he said, pledging to work with other elected officials and community leaders.  Greenberg wants either statewide action in Kentucky or a change to state laws that would allow him to pass reforms in just his city. While he has had preliminary conversations with lawmakers at the state capital on both sides of the aisle, he said more meetings are expected to happen in the coming days to “talk about what we can do together” Police released several minutes of officer body camera video Tuesday evening. And Greenberg said two things stood out to him about the footage —&nbsp;first is the bravery of the officers who ran into the building, and the second was the tragedy of watching the events unfold. “Our city is heartbroken” for those killed, the mayor said when asked how the community is reacting., Juliana Farmer, one of the five people killed in a Louisville bank on Monday, is being remembered by her family as someone who loved life. “Her siblings, they lost a sister. Her children lost a mother. Their children lost a grandmother,” Farmer's aunt, Vicki Brooks-Scott told CNN affiliate WAVE. “I lost a niece.”&nbsp; Farmer, an employee at the bank, had only recently moved to Louisville from Henderson, Brooks-Scott said. “This was her third week on the job," she said.&nbsp; Farmer, 45, leaves behind three children and four grandchildren, Brooks-Scott said. A fifth grandchild is expected to arrive in September, she added. “I’m hoping that this baby will be born on September 20th because that was her birthday,” she said., Editor's note:&nbsp;This post contains graphic descriptions of violence. LMPD Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey detailed the tense moments when police attempted to rescue&nbsp;Officer Nickolas Wilt, who was shot in the head as police rushed to the scene of the shooting early Monday. Wilt, a 26-year-old rookie officer, is in critical condition at a local hospital. He graduated from the police academy just 11 days ago. The gunfire broke the bank windows, allowing Galloway to find a vantage point to see where the gunman was located, Humphrey said. “Once he is able to see the threat, he then engages the threat, shoots and kills the suspect." Galloway suffered a minor gunshot wound., When the shooting was over, officers and teams from other agencies reentered the bank with supplies and started providing medical treatment right away, Louisville Metro Police Department Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey said. After talking to medical staff, Humphrey said it is "100% certainty" that those swift actions saved lives. He said EMS need to ride in the back of the ambulance with the patients, but they were short-staffed, so police officers offered to drive so the EMS workers could treat a victim on the way to the hospital., The gunman in Monday's shooting appeared to be waiting for police officers to arrive at Old National Bank, according to Louisville Metro Police Department Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey.  At a Tuesday news conference, Humphrey said the shooter went to the bank's front lobby "after assaulting the victims in the office area.", Editor's note:&nbsp;This post contains graphic descriptions of violence.

Officer Nickolas Wilt, 26, who ran toward the gunfire, was shot in the head during the incident, police previously announced.  He had graduated from the police academy just 10 days before the shooting, police said. He is in critical condition at the hospital, officials tell CNN., Body camera footage shows that Officer Nickolas Wilt went back into the line of fire to protect people, Louisville Metro Police Department Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey said during a news conference Tuesday.  Humphrey emphasized the role and mission of police is to protect lives and constitutional rights and that's what officers did during the deadly shooting at a Louisville bank Monday.   Humphrey commended Wilt's bravery. Wilt was shot in the head when police confronted the gunman at the bank., Several minutes of police body camera video from the deadly bank shooting in Lousiville, Kentucky, shows the bravery of the responding officers, the department's Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwynn-Villaroel said. The chief said moving forward, it is time for healing and compassion, but added that officers will remain "prepared to face and conquer" future threats. Police previously said officers arrived at the bank three minutes after being notified of the shooting. Three officers were injured, and one had to have brain surgery, officials said., Louisville officials are releasing bodycam footage of Monday's deadly bank shooting and will show it at a news briefing happening now.  According to the Louisville Metro Police Department, the six to seven minutes of bodycam footage will show multiple angles of officers responding to the shooting.  In addition to the surveillance footage, CNN reported that the shooter, identified as a 25-year-old bank employee, live streamed the attack on Instagram. The video has been taken down. A city official described the footage to CNN, saying the shooter fired his AR-15-style weapon inside the bank for about a minute and then appeared to wait a minute and a half before police arrived. Earlier Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Louisville mayor told CNN the office hopes to release the 911 call audio of the shooting on Tuesday., Officer Nickolas Wilt, who was shot in the head when police confronted the gunman at the Louisville bank on Monday, is a volunteer firefighter and is active with the LaGrange Fire and Rescue Department, according to the department's chief Jim Sitzler.&nbsp; He has volunteered with the department since 2016,  “He also worked for Oldham county dispatch as a dispatch and EMS," Sitzler told CNN, who described him as an asset to the department.&nbsp; Sitzler said public service is in Wilt’s DNA.&nbsp; The rookie police officer is still in critical condition after undergoing surgery, Sitzler said., Body camera footage from officers responding to the Louisville bank shooting is expected to be released Tuesday evening, according to Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg. A video package will be played and discussed at a 5 p.m. ET news conference, the mayor said.  According to the Louisville Metro Police Department, six to seven minutes of bodycam footage showing multiple angles of officers responding to the shooting will be released.  Greenberg said the video “will focus on the interactions between the shooter and police" and that it will be “respectful” in terms of sensitivity toward victims. The video will then be uploaded to a YouTube page for distribution. 911 calls related to the incident are not expected to be released Tuesday, the police department's public information officer, Matthew Sanders told CNN., Body camera footage showing the confrontation between police and the gunman who killed five people at a Louisville bank is expected to be released Tuesday evening.   Meantime, police are uncovering new details about the shooter. The department's chief said that the gun used in the attack was purchased less than a week ago. Here's what to know to get up to speed: Timeline: The entire incident lasted about 9 minutes, Louisville Metro Police Department Lt. Col. Aaron Crowell said. The shooting began just after 8:30 a.m. — about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public, police said. It happened during a morning employee meeting, with some appearing in person and others virtually, according to a manager at the bank. The shooter fired his weapon for about a minute and then appeared to wait a minute and a half before police arrived, according to a city official. When officers got there, they shot and killed the gunman, said Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the Louisville Metro Police Department.\nThe weapon: The shooter used an AR-15-style rifle in the attack, which was purchased six days ago, police said. He bought the weapon legally from a local dealership on April 4, Gwinn-Villaroel said. Police also said they executed a search warrant on his house and recovered some other items. Gwinn-Villaroel would not specify what they were.\nVideo of the shooting: The responding officer's body camera footage is expected to be released Tuesday evening, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. Police also said the shooter live-streamed the incident on Instagram. Meta, the parent company of the platform, said that video was taken down. A city official said investigators are in possession of the video.\nDispatcher audio: A Louisville Metro Police dispatcher said in an audio that the gunman had left a voicemail saying he was going to kill everyone at the bank. "He's texted&nbsp;a friend, called a friend, left a voicemail saying he's&nbsp;gonna&nbsp;kill everyone at the bank. Feeling suicidal," the dispatcher said, according to Broadcastify audio.\nVictims: The five victims were identified as Joshua Barrick, 40; Juliana Farmer, 45; Tommy Elliott, 63; James Tutt, 64, and Deana Eckert, 57. \nHospital response: Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer, said his hospital used 170 units of blood on Monday to treat victims from the bank shooting. He credited the Red Cross and blood donations with saving lives. On Tuesday, four patients were still at the University of Louisville Hospital, a spokesperson said. The rookie officer who was shot in the head remains sedated in the intensive care unit, Smith said.\nCalls for action: Greenberg said that 40 people have now been killed by guns this year in his city, and he made a plea for the state and federal governments to take action on gun violence or to cede that power to the city. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat from Kentucky, called for Republicans to pass gun reform policies saying that the issue is not political. Smith said having to treat so many victims of gun violence, day in and day out, has made him grow "weary."\nVigil planned: A local vigil will be held Wednesday at 5 p.m. ET at the Muhammad Ali Center to honor the victims of the shooting and unite as a community, the mayor said., A majority of adults or their family members in the United States have been affected by a gun-related incident, according to a new&nbsp;survey&nbsp;from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Over half of US adults, 54%, have either personally or had a family member who has been impacted by such an incident, such as witnessing a shooting, being threatened by a gun, or been injured or killed by a gun. Nearly 1 in 5 adults has had a family member killed by a gun, including in homicide and suicide. About as many adults have been personally threatened with a gun, and about 1 in 6 adults has witnessed an injury from a shooting, the survey found. The new report came less than a day after a shooter killed five people in Louisville, Kentucky. Mass shootings have escalated in recent years, reaching a record pace in 2023. There have been at least 146&nbsp;incidents&nbsp;so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, leaving more than 200 people dead and hundreds more injured. About half of all gun-related deaths are suicides, federal&nbsp;data&nbsp;shows. And the suicide rate has also recently increased, reversing years of decline and returning to near-record levels. The vast majority of adults say they worry at least sometimes that they or someone in their family will become a victim of gun violence, the new KFF survey found. Nearly a quarter of parents of children younger than 18 say they worry about it daily or almost daily. Guns are now the leading cause of death among children and teens in the US, surpassing car accidents in 2020.  According to the new KFF survey, Black adults are more than twice as likely as White adults to have lost a loved one to gun violence and to have personally witnessed someone being shot. Read more about the survey., Louisville Metro Police Department Lt. Col. Aaron Crowell provided a few more specifics about the timeline of the fatal shooting at a bank Monday that left five dead.  During a briefing on Tuesday, Crowell said that the shooter was "neutralized" approximately three minutes after police responded.  Crowell reiterated that the gun purchased by the shooter in the fatal bank shooting was an AR-15-style rifle.&nbsp; Louisville Interim Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said it was a "targeted" incident, as the shooter — who was an employee of the bank — knew the victims. Police said they don’t know whether armed guards were present in the building. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg added that the shooting took place on the first floor of the bank building, and there were other people in the building at the time who were later cleared from the scene by police.  Authorities said a third officer was injured as a result of the incident, but not from a gunshot wound. CNN's Michelle Krupa contributed to this report., The Louisville Metro Police Department has opened two separate investigations following Monday's shooting at Old National Bank — one under the purview of homicide and another under the scope of its Public Integrity Unit, a police official said. How the events unfolded: The shooting began around 8:30 a.m. ET, police said, about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public. Bank staff were holding their morning meeting in a conference room when the shooter opened fire, bank manager Rebecca Buchheit-Sims said. One bank employee frantically called her husband as she sheltered inside a locked vault, the husband, Caleb Goodlett told CNN affiiliate&nbsp;WLKY. By the time he called 911, police were already aware of the shooting, he said. The gunman, who was still firing when police arrived, was killed in a shootout with officers, police said.  Nickolas Wilt, a 26-year-old rookie officer, ran toward the gunfire and was shot in the head, interim Louisville Metro Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. He had graduated from the police academy just 10 days before the shooting. The officer is sedated in the intensive care unit, Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer at UofL Health, said at Tuesday's news conference. CNN’s John Miller, Laura Ly, Artemis Moshtaghian, Celina Tebor, Caroll Alvarado, Kristina Sgueglia, Sara Smart and Eric Levenson contributed to this report., Dr. Jason Smith, chief medical officer for UofL Health, said having to treat so many victims of gun violence, day in and day out, has made him grow "weary." Smith said that his hospital "barely had to adjust our&nbsp;operating room schedule" on Monday because that's "how&nbsp;frequent we are having to deal&nbsp;with gun violence in our&nbsp;community." He continued: "There's only&nbsp;so many times you can walk into&nbsp;a room. And tell someone they're&nbsp;not coming home tomorrow. And it&nbsp;just breaks your heart. When you&nbsp;hear someone screaming, 'Mommy' or&nbsp;'Daddy.' It just becomes too hard&nbsp;day in and day out to be able to&nbsp;do that." Watch here:, Rep. Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat from Kentucky, called for Republicans to pass gun reform policies saying that the issue is not political.  "I had somebody&nbsp;tell me the other day. Don't&nbsp;make this political.  Fine. Don't&nbsp;make this political. People's&nbsp;lives aren't political. Public&nbsp;safety isn't political. Put&nbsp;those policies in place that put&nbsp;people first. People over guns,&nbsp;kids over guns, public safety&nbsp;over guns. Because that is what we need to address this problem," McGarvey added.  McGarvey discussed crisis aversion legislation that he has introduced to temporarily remove fire arms from those who are going through a crisis. He called on his colleagues to support those efforts in bipartisan way, including pushing for universal background checks.  "We can&nbsp;do this. We can come together at&nbsp;the federal level, working with&nbsp;each other to solve this problem, which is impacting all of us in a uniquely American way," he said.  He then called out the Republicans for working harder on identify politics than on gun reform.  McGarvey said things like getting "weapons of war off our streets" and "helping people who are in crisis" are not a "political issue," but "it becomes one when&nbsp;Kentucky Republicans would rather ban books and pronouns and then make Kentucky&nbsp;a sanctuary state for weapons." "We&nbsp;are hurting. And no matter&nbsp;what&nbsp;policy&nbsp;we&nbsp;passed, no, it&nbsp;will not bring back these&nbsp;people," he added., Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said that 40 people have now been killed by guns this year in his city, giving an impassioned plea for state and federal government to take action on gun violence or to cede that power to the city.  "That level of gun violence&nbsp;is beyond horrific," he said in a Tuesday briefing.  "We have to&nbsp;take action now. We need short-term action to end this gun&nbsp;violence epidemic now so fewer&nbsp;people die on our streets, and in&nbsp;our banks, and in our schools and in our churches. And for&nbsp;that, we need help. We need help&nbsp;from our friends in Frankfurt and help from our friends in&nbsp;Washington, DC.," the mayor said.   As a Democratic candidate for mayor, Greenberg was the target of a shooting at his campaign headquarters. "Last year, I survived a workplace shooting.&nbsp;And&nbsp;now&nbsp;yesterday, I've lost a&nbsp;very close friend in another&nbsp;workplace shooting," the mayor said.  Greenberg said that the state law should be changed to address Louisville's response to gun violence.  "Let us, the people of Louisville, make our own choices about how&nbsp;we reduce gun violence in our&nbsp;city," he said., The man who opened fire at a Louisville bank, killing five people, purchased the weapon he used in the attack six days ago, police said. Louisville Metro Police Department Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said the shooter bought the weapon legally from a local dealership on April 4. Lt. Col. Aaron Crowell said the shooter used an AR-15 rifle in the shooting., Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said a local vigil will be held Wednesday at 5 p.m. ET at the Muhammad Ali Center to honor the victims of Monday's bank shooting and unite as a community., The Louisville Metro Police Department will release body-worn camera footage of Monday's shooting at Old National Bank on Tuesday afternoon, Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel announced., Dr. Jason Smith, chief medical officer for UofL Health, said that his hospital used 170 units of blood on Monday to treat victims from the bank shooting. Smith thanked the American Red Cross and their organization's efforts in getting the hospital additional blood needed for treatment.  He said the blood needed "far outstrips" the hospital's capacity and credited the Red Cross's efforts with helping to save lives., Louisville officials are holding a briefing now on Monday's fatal workplace shooting and the latest on the investigation.  The release about the briefing said officials will “provide updates on the aftermath of Monday’s shooting and announce a planned vigil.” Here's who we expect to speak at the briefing: Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg\nKentucky Rep. Morgan McGarvey\nLouisville Metro Police Department Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel\nDr. Jason Smith, chief medical officer of UofL Health, An additional patient was discharged from UofL Hospital on Tuesday, a hospital spokesperson told CNN. Out of the nine patients originally hospitalized:  Four have been discharged\nFour remain in the hospital\nOne has died One of the four patients in the hospital is in critical condition, and the other three are in stable and fair condition, according to the hospital spokesperson. CNN reported Monday that a fifth victim had died later in the day. CNN also reported that a rookie Louisville police officer – who graduated from the police academy just 10 days ago –  underwent brain surgery after being shot in the head, police said Monday.  The interim police chief told CNN Tuesday morning that the officer was still in critical condition, but stable. Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer at UofL Health, later added at a news conference that the officer is sedated in the intensive care unit., James “Jim” Tutt, one of the victims of Monday's Old National Bank shooting, was a “huge fan and supporter” of the downtown Louisville area and actively helped to promote it, Rebecca Fleischaker, the executive director of the Downtown Development Corporation, told CNN.&nbsp; Tutt was on the board of the Downtown Development Corporation since 2018 and recently served as treasurer, according to Fleischaker.  The nonprofit organization works on improving the Louisville downtown area by promoting redevelopment, vitality, economic growth, and a safe environment, according to their website. Tutt, who was 64 and a native of Frankfort, Kentucky, worked as the commercial real estate (CRE) market executive at Old National Bank in downtown Louisville since 2015, his LinkedIn shows. “The Louisville Downtown Partnership staff send our love and heartfelt condolences to his wife and family as well as his Old National family, for enduring what should be the unthinkable,” Fleischaker said., Body camera footage of the police response to the Louisville shooting will be released within the next 24 to 48 hours, according to Kevin Trager, spokesperson at the mayor’s office. He also said the footage&nbsp;will not&nbsp;be released at the upcoming 11:30 a.m. ET briefing with officials, The Louisville Metro Police Department is planning a meeting Tuesday to go over what videos might be released related to Monday's shooting at Old National Bank. The department will also discuss the process of showing the videos to the families so they can view them first before they are released to news organizations, according to a law enforcement source. Police intend to release the videos before this evening, and there could be an evening news conference, the source said., Five patients are still being treated at University of Louisville Hospital on Tuesday, with one patient upgraded from critical to fair condition, a hospital spokesperson told CNN. One of the five patients is still in critical condition, and the other four are in stable and fair condition.&nbsp; Nine patients in total, including three Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) officers, were treated at the hospital following Monday’s shooting, the spokesperson said. Three of those patients have been discharged. Five of the nine patients sustained gunshot wounds, and one of the patients died Monday night. LMPD identified the patient who died as 57-year-old Deana Eckert., Investigators combing through Instagram video of the shooting saw firsthand the horror that unfolded Monday, watching the shooter fire his AR-15-style weapon inside the bank for about a minute and then appearing to wait a minute and a half before police arrive, according to a city official.  It’s unclear why the gunman stopped shooting.&nbsp; The video shows that his attack on bank workers lasted about a minute, the official told CNN. The live stream begins with the clearly visible AR-15-style weapon before a worker inside the bank says good morning to the gunman, according to the official. “You need to get out of here,” the shooter is heard saying to the woman on the live stream, which was eventually taken down by Instagram’s parent company Meta.&nbsp; According to that official, the gunman then tries to shoot her in the back but can’t because the safety is on and the weapon still needed to be loaded, the official said. Once the shooter loads the weapon properly and takes the safety off, he shoots the worker in the back, the official said. Her condition is not known.&nbsp; The shooter then continues his rampage, firing at workers while they try to outrun the gunman, the official said.  The shooter does not go to other floors of the bank where workers were already present, the official said.&nbsp; Once the shooter was done firing, he sat down in the lobby area that looks out onto East Main Street and&nbsp;appears to wait&nbsp;for police, the official said. The gunman waited roughly a minute and a half before police arrived and engaged the shooter in the gun battle, according to the official., Authorities "will make every effort" to release body camera and surveillance footage of the bank shooting "as soon as possible," Louisville Metro Police spokesperson Aaron Ellis said. “We are still in the infancy of this investigation,” he added. A spokesperson for the Louisville mayor also told CNN the office hopes to release the 911 call audio of Monday's shooting at Old National Bank later Tuesday.  The mayor has seen the surveillance footage, the spokesperson said.&nbsp; “It’s clear the initial responding officers immediately engaged the shooter,” the spokesperson said, adding the officers undoubtedly saved lives and noting there were other people in the building. Separately, a Louisville Metro Police dispatcher said in an audio that the gunman, identified as Connor Sturgeon, had left a voicemail saying he was going to kill everyone at the bank. "He's texted&nbsp;a friend, called a friend, left a voicemail saying he's&nbsp;gonna&nbsp;kill everyone at the bank. Feeling suicidal," the dispatcher said in the audio, according to Broadcastify audio. Editor’s Note:&nbsp;If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 (or&nbsp;800-273-8255) to connect with a trained counselor or visit the&nbsp;NSPL site. CNN's Michelle Watson&nbsp;contributed reporting to this post., Old National Bank CEO Jim Ryan and other members of the bank’s leadership team are in Louisville Tuesday to provide support to individuals affected by Monday's mass shooting, according to a statement from the bank, which adds that they will continue to be there in the days ahead. "Obviously, this is an incredibly difficult situation, and our entire focus is on making sure that everyone affected has the support and assistance they need," the CEO’s statement reads. “On behalf of everyone at Old National, I also want to acknowledge and thank Louisville law enforcement, the medical community and state and local officials for their incredible response to this tragedy. And finally, we ask you to please continue to pray for all those affected.”, The shooting at Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, began around 8:30 a.m. ET, police said, about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public. Bank staff were holding their morning meeting in a conference room when the shooter opened fire, Rebecca Buchheit-Sims, the bank manager, said. One bank employee frantically called her husband as she sheltered inside a locked vault, the husband, Caleb Goodlett told CNN affiiliate&nbsp;WLKY. By the time he called 911, police were already aware of the shooting, he said. “Just a very traumatic phone call to get,” Goodlett told the affiliate, adding that he has since seen his wife and she is OK. The gunman, who was still firing when police arrived, was killed in a shootout with officers, police officials said.  Nickolas Wilt, a 26-year-old rookie officer, ran toward the gunfire and was shot in the head, interim Louisville Metro Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. He had graduated from the police academy just 10 days before the shooting. Wilt underwent brain surgery and was in critical but stable condition as of Monday afternoon, the chief said. The gun used in the shooting was an AR-15-style rifle, a federal law enforcement source told CNN. The semi-automatic rifle is the most popular sporting rifle in the US, and 30% of gun owners reported having owned an AR-15 or similar-style rifle, according to the 2021&nbsp;National Firearms Survey. The AR-15 and its offshoots have been the weapon of choice in many of the most horrific mass shootings in recent memory, including the Covenant school shooting in Nashville just two weeks ago. The bank sits on the fringe of Louisville’s developing downtown business district, state&nbsp;Sen. Gerald Neal, who represents the district where the shooting happened, told CNN.&nbsp; CNN’s John Miller, Laura Ly, Artemis Moshtaghian, Celina Tebor, Caroll Alvarado, Kristina Sgueglia, Sara Smart and Eric Levenson contributed to this report., Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg praised his community after a bank shooting Monday that left five people dead. In a CNN interview alongside Louisville Metro Police Department Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, Greenberg — who said he himself is a survivor of gun violence in the workplace — encouraged those impacted by the shooting to "take time with loved ones." The mayor said his friend Tommy Elliott, who was killed in the shooting, was a "great friend" and "the definition of loyalty." Elliott was also a friend to Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and others around the city, he said.&nbsp; He recounted having not known whether another friend had survived yesterday's attack. The mayor said when he saw his friend in the hospital, he was overwhelmed. "We both survived," the mayor said he told his friend, encouraging him to see a therapist and talk to professionals. While the mayor said he doesn’t personally know the others who died, from the stories he has heard, "they are wonderful as well.", In an interview with CNN, Louisville's interim police chief offered few further details about the developing investigation into the fatal workplace shooting at a downtown bank in the Kentucky city, revealing that the gunman recently purchased the weapon used in the shooting without providing any more information. Louisville Metro Interim Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel confirmed that police searched the suspect's home Monday, adding she hopes the items that were recovered will help shed light on the motive. She did not say whether any other search warrants were executed. Asked about a note the shooter wrote indicating he was going to carry out a shooting at the bank, the interim chief said the investigation was in preliminary stages. She said that Officer Nickolas Wilt, who was shot in the head while responding to the shooting, was in critical but stable condition and “looking better.” Wilt graduated from the police academy less than two weeks ago. She asked for prayers for him and the families of others who lost their lives to “senseless” violence., Meta, the parent company of Instagram, confirmed that they took down a live-stream video of the Louisville bank shooting. "We are in touch with law enforcement and quickly removed the live stream," a Meta spokesperson said.&nbsp; Meta declined to comment if the video was taken down on its own or at the request of law enforcement.&nbsp; Sources previously told CNN that the&nbsp;shooting was live streamed on Instagram and has been take down but not immediately after the shooting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Police are in possession of the video, according to the source., The mass shooting at the Old National Bank on East Main Street in Louisville, Kentucky, began just after 8:30 a.m. — about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public, police said. It happened during a morning employee meeting, with some appearing in person and others virtually, Rebecca Buchheit-Sims, a manager at the bank, told CNN. She watched from her computer as her coworkers were gunned down. “I witnessed people being murdered. I don’t know how else to say that,” Buchheit-Sims said.&nbsp; Buchheit-Sims said she didn’t directly work with the gunman, Connor Sturgeon, but knew him because his father was her son’s high school basketball coach, and her husband was an assistant coach.&nbsp; “Just kind of a monotone personality,” she said of Sturgeon. “His temperament is pretty low key. I’ve never seen the kid get angry or upset about anything in public. He was pretty much just relaxed.”, President Joe Biden spoke over the phone&nbsp;with Kentucky Gov. Andy&nbsp;Beshear&nbsp;on Monday evening about the bank shooting yesterday in Louisville, the White House said. He had earlier condemned the latest mass shooting and called on Congress to&nbsp;act on gun reform., At least five people were killed and nine others were taken to the hospital after a gunman opened fire at Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, Monday morning. Here's what we know so far: Shooter:&nbsp;Police identified the gunman as Connor Sturgeon, 25, who was an employee at the bank. (At a news conference earlier Monday, police had described the shooter as a 23-year-old male. They amended his age&nbsp;Monday afternoon.) Sturgeon was notified that&nbsp;he was going to be fired,&nbsp;according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation, and he wrote a note that indicated that he was going to carry out a shooting at the bank. He was killed by police shortly after opening fire, according to Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the department.\nResponse:&nbsp;Officers arrived at the bank three minutes after the first call of the shooting, Gwinn-Villaroel said, adding that the fast response time saved lives. She said the gunman used a rifle.\nInvestigation:&nbsp;Police did not have&nbsp;"any prior engagement"&nbsp;with the shooter, according to Gwinn-Villaroel. Investigators are working to learn more about him. The gunman&nbsp;live streamed&nbsp;the attack on Instagram, police said. The video was subsequently taken down.\nVictims:&nbsp;Four of the victims who died Monday were identified as Joshua Barrick, 40; Juliana Farmer, 45; Tommy Elliott, 63; and James Tutt, 64, the chief said. Later that evening, police said a fifth victim – 57-year-old Deana Eckert – also died. Several victims remain hospitalized, including a police officer in critical condition after a shootout with the gunman.\nReaction:&nbsp;President Joe Biden condemned the latest mass shooting and called on Congress to&nbsp;act on gun reform. Democratic Rep. Morgan McGarvery, who represents Louisville in Congress, and state Sen. Karen Berg, who also represents parts of the city, also&nbsp;called for action&nbsp;to address gun violence. Gov.

Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021, was found&nbsp;guilty&nbsp;Tuesday of all four counts of involuntary manslaughter in a&nbsp;novel legal case&nbsp;that stood as a test of the limits of who’s responsible for a school shooting.\nCrumbley, 45, faces up to 15 years in prison, and her sentencing hearing is set for April 9. She has been behind bars since her&nbsp;arrest in a Detroit warehouse&nbsp;days after the shooting.\nHer husband, James Crumbley, is scheduled to go to trial on the same charges in early March. Our live coverage has ended. Scroll through the posts below to read about today's verdict., A jury found Jennifer Crumbley guilty of manslaughter after her son killed four students at a Michigan high school in 2021. The shooter's father, James Crumbley, is set to go to trial next month. There have been several other cases in which parents were charged for shootings carried out by their children, though not one in a school mass shooting. For example,&nbsp;the father of the July 4 mass shooter in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, Illinois,&nbsp;was accused of wrongdoing for&nbsp;signing his son’s application&nbsp;for an&nbsp;Illinois Firearm Owners Identification card&nbsp;months after his son displayed concerning behavior. The father, Robert Crimo Jr., ultimately&nbsp;pleaded guilty&nbsp;to misdemeanor reckless conduct charges and agreed to serve 60 days in jail. In a similar vein, the mother of a&nbsp;6-year-old boy who shot his teacher&nbsp;at a Virginia school last year faced charges. The boy’s mother ultimately pleaded guilty to a&nbsp;state child neglect charge&nbsp;and felony charges of unlawful use of a controlled substance while possessing a firearm and making a false statement while purchasing a firearm. But, the level of severity in the case of the Crumbleys is different. In a&nbsp;written opinion filed last March, a&nbsp;panel of judges for the state’s appellate court acknowledged the possible precedent-setting nature of these cases but called the situation unique and unusual. Joey Jackson, a CNN legal analyst, said the prosecution’s broad goal in bringing these cases was to deter other parents., The jury foreperson in the trial of Jennifer Crumbley — the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021 — said the fact that Crumbley was the last adult&nbsp;seen&nbsp;with the gun before the shooting “really hammered it home.”&nbsp; “Lives hung in the balance, and we took that very seriously,” the woman, who identified herself as the foreperson in the courtroom and who read the jury's verdict, said. She declined to give her name. She said “both sides were well represented” when asked whether the jurors had to convince each other while deliberating.&nbsp; During her closing arguments, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald put up a photo of Jennifer Crumbley leaving the gun range on November 27, 2021, carrying the gun in a case that her son used in the shooting. “This is the last picture we have of that gun until we see it murder four kids on November 30, and the person holding it is Jennifer Crumbley. She’s the last person we see with that gun,” McDonald said., James Crumbley, whose son killed four people in a mass shooting at a Michigan high school in 2021, is set to go to trial on March 5. He has pleaded not guilty to four charges of involuntary manslaughter for his alleged role in the shooting. It comes after the shooter's mother, Jennifer Crumbley, was found guilty of the same charges on Tuesday. The evidence and arguments in James Crumbley's trial may differ. At first, they had been working toward a joint defense, but their cases were separated after their defense learned of a conflict between the two. According to a prosecution filing from last year, Jennifer Crumbley “placed blame” on her husband in the shooting, leading to the split. Why this is important: In bringing manslaughter charges, prosecutors alleged the gunman’s parents are also responsible for the students’ deaths — a novel and unusual legal theory.  Parents have been charged for their child’s actions before, but not in this specific way, according to Misty Marris, a trial attorney who has followed the case., Jennifer Crumbley was convicted of four counts of involuntary manslaughter Tuesday afternoon. She pleaded not guilty to all four counts for her role in the November 30, 2021,&nbsp;mass shooting at Oxford High School, which left four students dead and seven other people wounded, including a teacher.&nbsp; Here's what both sides argued during the trial: The prosecution argued Crumbley was responsible for the deaths because she was “grossly negligent” in giving a gun to her son Ethan, who was 15 at the time, and failing to get him proper mental health treatment despite warning signs. Over a week of testimony, law enforcement officials, school employees, shooting victims and those who knew Jennifer Crumbley testified for the prosecution.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe defense argued the blame laid elsewhere: on her husband for improperly securing the firearm; on the school for failing to notify her about her son’s behavioral issues; and on Ethan himself, who planned and carried out the attack on his own. Defense attorney Shannon Smith said the case was “dangerous” for parents everywhere.&nbsp;During her trial, Jennifer Crumbley took the stand in her own defense and said she wouldn't have done anything differently.\nThe big picture: Broadly, the prosecution’s case relied on an unusual and novel legal strategy and represents an attempt to expand the scope of blame in mass shootings. And in its specifics, the trial provided an intimate view of the collapse of one American family.&nbsp;Crumbley’s husband, James, is scheduled to go on trial on the same charges in early March., Craig Shilling, the father of Justin Shilling, one of the four students killed in the 2021 mass shooting at Oxford High School, said the guilty verdict for the mother of the shooter was emotional. “It was a long time coming, but it's definitely a step toward accountability," Shilling told reporters outside the courtroom on Tuesday. Jennifer Crumbley was found guilty of four counts of manslaughter and is set to be sentenced on April 9. Each count carries a maximum punishment of up to 15 years in prison, which would run concurrently.&nbsp; He said parents need to address “things at every level” and there’s “no way to look the other way” now. In the case of Jennifer Crumbley, the father said many things could have stopped the shooting before it started. "You cannot choose to take your&nbsp;own interests over your child,&nbsp;especially when it comes to&nbsp;mental health and addressing,&nbsp;you know, concerns, the&nbsp;problem.&nbsp;Everything about that was&nbsp;disturbing," Shilling said., Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald hugged the fathers of Justin Shilling and Madisyn Baldwin before she left the courtroom. Both 17-year-olds were killed in the mass shooting at Oxford High School on November 30, 2021.  Hana St. Juliana, 14, and Tate Myre, 16, were also killed in the shooting.&nbsp;Six other students and a teacher were injured., Jennifer Crumbley, who was&nbsp;convicted of four counts of involuntary manslaughter Tuesday, is scheduled to be sentenced on April 9. Each charge carries a maximum punishment of up to 15 years in prison. Crumbley’s husband, James, is scheduled to go on trial on the same charges in early March. Their son Ethan pleaded guilty to one count of&nbsp;terrorism&nbsp;causing death, four counts of murder and 19 other charges related to the deadly rampage. He was sentenced last year to&nbsp;life in prison without parole., Jennifer Crumbley remained looking down during the verdict. A jury found her guilty of manslaughter following a 2021 Michigan school shooting in which her son killed four students. There were no audible reactions in the gallery, but there were some tears. Two rows in the gallery were reserved for family of the victims. Crumbley left the courtroom shackled.  Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald went to hug two parents of victims before she left the courtroom. A few other prosecutors shook the parents’ hands as well., Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in a trial that stood as a test of the limits of who’s responsible for a school shooting.&nbsp; Jennifer Crumbley was convicted of four counts of involuntary manslaughter, a charge that comes with a maximum punishment of up to 15 years in prison for each count., As Michigan jurors deliberated on four counts of involuntary manslaughter against Jennifer Crumbley on Monday, they sent two questions separately to the judge. Here's what they were: The jury sent their first question after deliberating for just over two hours: The jury sought for clarification on instructions, asking if there are different ways to convict&nbsp;Crumbley. Judge Cheryl Matthews decided to tell them yes, and referred the jury to re-read part of her instructions, which says “the prosecutor asserts two different theories to support the charges of Involuntary Manslaughter.” The first theory is that Crumbley committed involuntary manslaughter because she failed to perform a legal duty. The second, is because she was grossly negligent.&nbsp; "Those theories are two different ways to prove the same crime. Either or both of these theories, if proven, are sufficient to establish the crime of involuntary manslaughter," the instructions explain. The second question came an hour later: The jury asked if they can infer anything from evidence or witnesses that the prosecution did not bring, specifically not bring in the shooter or other people who could answer how specifically Ethan Crumbley got the gun. Judge Matthews brought the jury in to tell them they can only consider the evidence that was brought in at trial., A jury has reached a verdict in the manslaughter trial of Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021, in a trial that stands as a test of the limits of who’s responsible for a school shooting.&nbsp; She faces four counts of involuntary manslaughter. The verdict will be read in court shortly., A jury has reached a verdict in the manslaughter trial of Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021. Jennifer Crumbley is on trial for manslaughter in a case that will test the limits of who is responsible for a mass shooting. She pleaded not guilty to four charges of involuntary manslaughter for their alleged&nbsp;roles in her son’s rampage, which left four students dead and seven others wounded. She faces up to 15 years in prison. Her husband, James, is scheduled to go to trial on the same charges in early March. In bringing manslaughter charges, prosecutors alleged the gunman’s parents are also responsible for the students’ deaths – a novel and unusual legal theory. In particular, prosecutors accuse the gunman’s parents of disregarding the risks when they bought a gun for their son four days before the shooting, even though he was struggling with his mental health and contemplating violence. They also say the parents did not mention the gun to school officials in a meeting to discuss Ethan’s disturbing drawings just hours before the fatal shooting., A jury has reached a verdict in the manslaughter trial of Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021. The verdict will be read soon. Her son Ethan Crumbley&nbsp;was sentenced to life in prison without parole in December for the shooting, which left another wounding six students and a teacher injured. In that sentencing, Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Kwamé Rowe dismissed last-minute defense pleas that Crumbley’s life is salvageable and noted that the “defendant in his own words” told the court “this is nobody’s fault but his own.” Rowe said victim Justin Shilling, 17, was shot at point-blank range after being told by the defendant to get on his knees. Hana St. Juliana, 14, was shot a second time after she was down, he said, “to finish the job by shooting her again.” “That is an execution. That is torture. He shot most people multiple times. And, as he wrote, he did this for notoriety. And he wanted to go down … as the biggest school shooter in Michigan history.”, Jennifer Crumbley sent several messages criticizing her own parenting ability and discussing how the family’s firearm was secured shortly after her teenage son Ethan carried out a school shooting at his Michigan high school in November 2021, according to messages revealed in court Wednesday. Jennifer Crumbley wrote the messages as part of a lengthy conversation with Brian Meloche, a firefighter captain who testified he was in an extramarital romantic relationship with her at the time of the shooting. In several messages shown in court Wednesday, Jennifer Crumbley stated how the firearm used in the shooting was stored and secured. On the morning of the shooting, she said she had to go to her son’s school because she was worried he “was going to do something dumb,” Meloche testified. He responded by asking where her firearm was, and Jennifer said the gun was in her vehicle, he testified. However, other testimony has shown that the gun was in Ethan Crumbley’s backpack at school. Meloche also testified that he recalled telling Jennifer Crumbley to call 911 when she realized the gun was missing. He acknowledged that he deleted these and other messages from Facebook. A prosecutor told the jury that messages that were deleted by him and Crumbley could not be recovered by law enforcement., https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240201180525-jennifer-crumbley-trial-02012024-super-tease.jpeg, https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240201180525-jennifer-crumbley-trial-02012024-super-tease.jpeg, https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240201180525-jennifer-crumbley-trial-02012024-super-tease.jpeg, https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/w_460/5b22dd4a-c3df-48af-a0c8-28d8586d0dec.jpg, https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240201180525-jennifer-crumbley-trial-02012024-super-tease.jpeg, https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/w_460/04011236-3a3e-49cd-a2ff-b0c6d26ce223.jpg, https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/w_460/90134ca8-fe8d-43b5-9466-b839498f9f46.jpg, https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/w_460/c9179f38-56e2-4c01-b209-58bd72eda484.jpg, https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240201180525-jennifer-crumbley-trial-02012024-super-tease.jpeg, https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/w_460/1d094c03-2095-4525-aa79-6efc4abd23e5.jpg, https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240201180525-jennifer-crumbley-trial-02012024-super-tease.jpeg, https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/w_460/2c6f76e8-7ac1-42c1-9f72-5c87d6cc36ca.jpg, https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240201180525-jennifer-crumbley-trial-02012024-super-tease.jpeg, https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/w_460/11a5ccce-c645-4a23-a557-6eb78498ba99.jpg, https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240201180525-jennifer-crumbley-trial-02012024-super-tease.jpeg

police said. The shooter's "weapon of choice" was a rifle and he was shot and killed by law enforcement, police said.\nThe gunman live-streamed the attack on Instagram, police said. The video was subsequently taken down, according to the source. \nA local hospital received nine patients following the shooting – two police officers and seven civilians, officials said. Three patients have been released and three are in critical condition, including a police officer, authorities added., Our live coverage of the Louisville bank shooting has moved here., The death toll in the Louisville bank shooting has risen to five, the Louisville Metro Police Department said late Monday., President Joe Biden spoke by phone to Kentucky Gov. Andy&nbsp;Beshear&nbsp;Monday evening about the shooting at a Louisville bank that left four people dead, the White House said. In a statement earlier Monday, Biden called out Republicans for what he said is a lack of action to protect communities. He said Congress needs to act on things like requiring safe storage of guns and background checks., A survivor of workplace gun violence himself, Louisville Mayor&nbsp;Craig Greenberg said he lost a very close friend, Thomas Elliot, in the Old National Bank shooting.  Greenberg said he was with Elliot's wife at the hospital earlier Monday morning. Elliot, a senior vice president at the bank, was also a close friend of Gov. Andy Beshear.  The mayor said he also visited Louisville Metro Police Officer Nickolas Wilt at the University of Louisville hospital saying he “made it through surgery and he's in serious condition at the hospital right now, but he is in great hands.”&nbsp; Greenberg said he handed Wilt his graduation diploma from the police academy just a week and a half ago., Rebecca Buchheit-Sims, a manager with Old National Bank, told CNN she virtually witnessed the shooting Monday through her computer during a Microsoft Teams meeting.&nbsp; “I’m just as much in shock and disbelief and was in disbelief as I watched it unravel,” she said of the incident, which she said “happened very quickly.”&nbsp; Buchheit-Sims said she didn’t directly work with the gunman, Connor Sturgeon, but knew him because his father was her son’s high school basketball coach, and her husband was an assistant coach.&nbsp; She described Sturgeon as someone with “just kind of a monotone personality."  “His temperament is pretty low-key. I’ve never seen the kid get angry or upset about anything in public. He was pretty much just relaxed," she said.  Buchheit-Sims said she didn’t know anything about Sturgeon having any grievances or previously making any threats. She recalled him as “extremely intelligent.”, At least four people were killed and nine others were taken to the hospital after a gunman opened fire at Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, Monday morning. Here's what we know so far: Shooter: Police identified the gunman as Connor Sturgeon, 25, who was an employee at the bank. (At a news conference earlier Monday, police had described the shooter as a 23-year-old male. They amended his age Monday afternoon.) Sturgeon was notified that he was going to be fired, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation, and wrote a note that indicated that he was going to shoot at the bank. He was killed by police shortly after opening fire, according to Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the department. \nResponse: Officers arrived at the bank three minutes after the first call of the shooting, Gwinn-Villaroel said, adding that the fast response time saved lives. She said the gunman used a rifle.\nInvestigation: Police did not have "any prior engagement" with the shooter, according to Gwinn-Villaroel. Investigators are working to learn more about the gunman. The shooting was live-streamed, Gwinn-Villaroel said, and that police are "hopeful" that they can get the footage taken offline.\nVictims: The four people killed were identified as Tommy Elliott, 63, Jim Tutt, 64, Josh Barrick, 40, and Juliana Farmer, 45, according to updated information from the police department. Nine people were taken to the hospital, said Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer at the University of Louisville Health. Three people have since been discharged, he said. Three others are in critical condition, including a recently graduated police officer who was shot in the head and had to have brain surgery, Gwinn-Villaroel said. One other officer was also injured.\nReaction: President Joe Biden condemned the latest mass shooting and called on Congress to act on gun reform. Democratic Rep. Morgan McGarvery, who represents Louisville in Congress, and State Sen. Karen Berg, who also represents parts of the city, also called for action to address gun violence. Gov.

In a&nbsp;statement Monday, Greenberg called the shooting at Old National Bank “another horrific tragedy” and asked for prayers for the “recovery of those who are receiving medical care, the families of those who lost a loved one, and those who are scared and heartbroken by what has happened this morning.” “Our deepest gratitude to the heroic efforts of first responders, who arrived within minutes of being called, and who risked their lives to save others. We will continue to provide updates throughout the day,” Greenberg said.  CNN’s Artemis Moshtaghian contributed to this report., White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday repeatedly called on Congress to take actions to address gun violence, refusing to explicitly say whether President Joe Biden has exhausted all legal efforts to further combat the issue through executive action.&nbsp; When asked during the White House press briefing if the president is at the end of his ability to do more on gun violence prevention, Jean-Pierre said, “So, there [are] actions that we have taken. The thing is the president cannot do it alone… there is a legislative process that needs to happen and Congress needs to act.”&nbsp; The comments came hours after&nbsp;four people were killed in a mass shooting&nbsp;at a Louisville, Kentucky, bank.&nbsp; Specifically, she added, Biden cannot work without Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage for firearms, require background checks for all gun safeties and eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.&nbsp; Pressed on whether the president has done all he can, Jean-Pierre said, “We're always going to find and figure out ways that we can take another step outside of all of the historic steps that this president has taken to announce another way to protect communities, but the president has done the work. Now we need Congress to act.”&nbsp; She said Biden has "done a historic amount of work recently" and pointed to a bipartisan bill he signed into law that year. Jean-Pierre also clarified that the administration is continuing to call on Congress to pass an assault weapons ban, even though that was not mentioned in the president’s recent statement in response to the Louisville shooting.&nbsp; She said it was “not a shift in strategy at all. We were just being mindful to the incoming information that was currently coming in from Louisville.”, Louisville shooter Connor Sturgeon was notified that he was going to be terminated from Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation.&nbsp; Sturgeon wrote a note for his parents and a friend indicating that he was going to shoot at the bank, the source said.&nbsp;    It is not clear whether that note was on paper or emailed, or whether it was seen before the incident or after, according to the source.&nbsp; The shooting was live-streamed on Instagram and has been taken down.&nbsp;Police are in possession of the video, according to the source., Connor Sturgeon, the 25-year-old identified by police as the gunman in Monday's mass shooting in Louisville, had worked for more than a year at the bank where he allegedly shot 13 people, killing&nbsp;at least&nbsp;four. At a news conference earlier Monday, police had described the shooter as a 23-year-old male. They amended his age to 25 later in the day.)  Sturgeon wrote on&nbsp;his LinkedIn profile&nbsp;that he interned at Old National Bank in Louisville for three consecutive summers between 2018 and 2020 before joining as a Commercial Development Professional in June 2021. He became a Syndications Associate and Portfolio Banker at the bank in April 2022, according to the profile. Sturgeon graduated from the University of Alabama in December 2020, according to a spokesperson for the university. He participated in an accelerated master's program, and earned both his bachelor's degree and a master's degree in finance at the same time, the spokesperson, Shane Dorrill, said. Earlier, Sturgeon&nbsp;played basketball&nbsp;and&nbsp;ran track&nbsp;for his high school in a Louisville suburb, and was&nbsp;named&nbsp;a semifinalist for a National Merit Scholarship in 2015, according to local news reports. A former high school classmate of Sturgeon’s who knew him and his family well said he never saw any “sort of red flag or signal that this could ever happen.” In a 2018&nbsp;college essay&nbsp;posted to the website CourseHero, a user identified as a University of Alabama student named Connor Sturgeon wrote that he had had trouble fitting in at school. “My self-esteem has long been a problem for me,” the essay read. “As a late bloomer in middle and high school, I struggled to a certain extent to fit in, and this has given me a somewhat negative self-image that persists today. Making friends has never been especially easy, so I have more experience than most in operating alone.” The author wrote that in college, he had “begun to mature socially and am beginning to see improvement in this area,” and that he hoped to “be more self-aware and start becoming a ‘better’ person.” Sturgeon's father, Todd Sturgeon,&nbsp;was head&nbsp;coach of&nbsp;the men’s basketball team at the University of Indianapolis for 10 years and later coached basketball and taught US history at his son’s high school, according to&nbsp;news reports&nbsp;and&nbsp;his LinkedIn profile. A 2007&nbsp;story&nbsp;published by Todd Sturgeon’s alma mater, DePauw University, quoted an Indianapolis Star article about his retirement from the University of Indianapolis that year, in which he said that watching his son Connor had inspired him to step down from the team. “Todd Sturgeon said he was watching his son, Connor, at a basketball camp recently when he had a realization: Maybe he'd rather have more time to spend with his own sons than other people's,” the article said., All state flags throughout Kentucky have been ordered to fly at half-staff until Friday evening to honor the victims of the Louisville bank shooting, Gov.

Law enforcement sources said a search of the suspect's last known address was conducted by FBI SWAT teams Thursday.\nRobert Card, 40, is facing an arrest warrant for eight counts of murder and should be considered armed and dangerous, police said. He is a certified firearms instructor and a member of the US Army Reserves, according to law enforcement.\nPolice are urging residents to shelter in place and report any suspicious activity to authorities. Lewiston is the state's second-largest city and is located about 36 miles north of Portland.\nThe rampage in Maine is the deadliest US mass shooting since&nbsp;the Uvalde school massacre. It adds to a grim docket of 565 such incidents, where four or more people are shot excluding the shooter, across the country this year, according to the&nbsp;Gun Violence Archive., Our live coverage of the hunt for the suspect in the Maine mass shooting has moved here, A shooting rampage in Lewiston, Maine, left 18 dead and 13 more injured Wednesday evening after a gunman opened fire on a bowling alley and a restaurant.  Lewiston is a sprawling residential and industrial area just off the Maine Turnpike and is home to two hospitals and the private liberal arts school Bates College. It’s a largely working-class community, with a median household income of about $48,000 and in which about 16% of the population lives in poverty, according to the&nbsp;US Census. Maine Gov. Janet Mills governor, who met her husband in Lewiston, described it as a “special place.” President Joe Biden has spoken by phone with Maine lawmakers and “offered full federal support in the wake of this horrific attack,” the White House said in a statement. Lewiston Mayor&nbsp;Carl Sheline is “heartbroken for our city and our people,” he said. “Lewiston is known for our strength and grit and we will need both in the days to come.” Lewiston Auburn Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce President Shanna Cox on Thursday called the scene of both attacks “family locations.” “It was family league activity at the bowling alley. The likeliness of this having direct impact for so many here is so real.” Auburn Mayor Jason Levesque lost friends in the shooting, he told “CNN This Morning.” A teenager who went to school with his son was shot and is expected to recover, he said. “There’s going to be very few people in this community that have not been touched by this,” he said. “It’s going to be with me for the rest of my life, and it’s really hard for me to explain that.” “The other folks that I knew that were there either as witnesses or family members of witnesses; it’s obviously traumatic,” Levesque said. “The bright spot was seeing individuals reunified with their loved ones after not knowing for so long, but on the on the other side, the ones that were waiting and waiting, probably would never be reunified.”, Peyton Brewer-Ross, 39, was participating in a cornhole tournament at Schemengees Bar and Grille when he was killed during Wednesday’s mass shooting in Lewiston, his brother Ralph Brewer told CNN.&nbsp; Brewer-Ross loved playing cornhole and enjoying hanging out with friends at Schemengees, his brother said. “It’s just surreal and sad. Now my brother is not here anymore along with 17 other people,” Brewer told CNN in a phone interview on Thursday. “He just went to play cornhole. He is the nicest person you would ever meet. He never had a bad thing to say about anyone.” Brewer-Ross “loved being a dad more than anything else,” his brother said. Two weeks ago, Brewer-Ross celebrated his daughter Elle's second birthday.&nbsp; In the past five years, Brewer-Ross worked his way through the iron pipefitter apprenticeship program and graduated last year. When he wasn’t spending time with his family, he enjoyed comics, cornhole, playing games and having fun with friends, his brother said.&nbsp; “We are walking around in a daze not knowing what to say, what to do, or how to act, because of a senseless shooting,” Brewer said. “It’s so unbelievable that this can continue to happen over and over again and nothing changes.”, The town of Lisbon, Maine, is asking residents to continue to shelter in place throughout the overnight hours as officials continue to search for the suspect in Wednesday night's deadly mass shooting. All Lisbon schools and town-owned buildings will be closed tomorrow, the update noted.&nbsp; Lisbon is about eight miles southeast of Lewiston, where the shooting rampage unfolded on Wednesday evening., Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) SWAT teams on Thursday conducted a search of the last known address associated with Robert Card, the suspect in a Wednesday night shooting rampage that left 18 people dead in Lewiston, law enforcement sources told CNN. The&nbsp;sources&nbsp;told CNN that&nbsp;once FBI SWAT&nbsp;teams cleared the house, investigators came in to execute the&nbsp;search&nbsp;warrant, looking for items like computers, notes, weapons and any evidence that&nbsp;might indicate a plan to carry out the&nbsp;shootings. Card, 40, is facing an arrest warrant for eight counts of murder and should be considered armed and dangerous, police said. State and local investigators did a similar style entry and search at another location, as well as a search of Card's car on Thursday, the sources told CNN. Law enforcement officials returned to the Lewiston shooting suspect's last known address on Thursday evening, according to CNN teams on site. At least five law enforcement vehicles, including an armored vehicle, were seen at the scene, CNN reported. A spokesperson with the Maine Department of Public Safety told CNN law enforcement is "not positive Robert Card is in this house," adding officials are "simply doing our due diligence." In Lisbon, investigators recovered a gun on Thursday while searching an abandoned car at a boat launch connected to the suspect, but it hasn’t been determined whether the firearm was used in Wednesday’s shooting rampage, a law enforcement source told CNN., Tommy Conrad, 34, was identified as one of the victims of the Lewiston, Maine, mass shootings, his family confirmed to CNN affiliate WMTW.  Conrad was the manager at the bowling alley, one of the two locations of last night's shooting rampage. He is survived by his nine-year-old daughter., Residents of Auburn should stay vigilant as the search for shooting suspect Robert Card continues, Mayor Jason Levesque said on Thursday.  “We are Mainers, stay vigilant, practice good situational awareness,” Levesque said. He said that the community is still in shock following the deadly shootings that took place in the neighboring town of Lewiston. The mayor highlighted the authorities and medics response to the shootings on Wednesday. “They all came in on-duty, off-duty,” Levesque said, “They rushed to the scene.”, Law enforcement officials returned to the Lewiston shooting suspect's last known address on Thursday evening, according to CNN teams on the scene. A spokesperson with the Maine Department of Public Safety, Shannon Moss, told CNN law enforcement is "not positive Robert Card is in this house," adding officials are "simply doing our due diligence."

The&nbsp;sources&nbsp;told CNN that&nbsp;once FBI SWAT&nbsp;teams cleared the house, investigators came in to execute the&nbsp;search&nbsp;warrant, looking for items like computers, notes, weapons and any evidence that&nbsp;might indicate a plan to carry out the&nbsp;shootings. CNN heard loud bangs near that address on Thursday, including someone shouting "FBI" through a bullhorn.  State and local investigators did a similar style entry and search at another location, as well as a search of Card's car on Thursday, the sources said. Similar searches of additional locations are expected in the coming days, the sources said., Multiple school districts and colleges in southern Maine announced they will be closed Friday as the search continues for the suspect in two shootings that left 18 people dead and 13 injured in Lewiston.

In remarks on the shooting Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre urged Congress to pass legislation to address the epidemic of gun violence.   She also cited a slew of executive orders President Joe Biden has signed as president to address gun violence, but acknowledged, “the president has been clear that executive action alone is just not enough.” Looking forward, Jean-Pierre said Biden “will continue to do everything in his power to protect the American people to protect our communities to protect our children, and we urge— we urge congressional Republicans to come to the table to come to the table if there truly is common ground at this time.” Jean-Pierre declined to say if Biden plans to visit Lewiston, Maine. She said it is a "dynamic situation on the ground" and that the administration's priority is "to make sure that Maine and local enforcement has the resources that it needs." She said Greg Jackson, the deputy director of the White House office of Gun Violence Prevention, convened federal agencies Thursday morning “to discuss federal resources already deployed and ensure readiness to meet any additional community needs as the people of Lewiston work through the unimaginable grief that they may be experiencing.”, Maine officials released a timeline of events surrounding Wednesday's deadly shooting rampage at two locations in Lewiston, Maine, which did not include police response time to the incidents. “That information will come out in an after-action review,” Maine Department of Public Safety Public Information Officer Shannon Moss explained, adding that law enforcement is focused on apprehending the suspect and an “after action review” was conducted after most “critical events.” Here's the timeline provided by the Maine Department of Public Safety: At 6:56 p.m., Wednesday, October 25, 2023: Auburn Communications Center was notified that a man walked into the Just-In-Time Recreation bowling alley on Mollison Street in Lewiston and began shooting.

Robert Card, 40, is being sought as a suspect, and police said he should be considered armed and dangerous. The attack appears to be the deadliest mass shooting of 2023, adding to a grim docket of 565 such incidents reported this year across the United States, with four or more shot excluding the shooter, according to the&nbsp;Gun Violence Archive. See photos below from the scene:, Tricia Asselin, 53, worked part-time at Just-In-Time Recreation in Lewiston, but was there bowling on Wednesday night when a gunman came in and opened fire, her brother told CNN Thursday.

He called Asselin his “baby sister” and said they were very close. He said her adult son is devastated by the loss. Asselin “was the rock of the family” and “kept everyone on an even keel," Johnson said. “If there was an argument going on, she would be the one to calm everyone down.

She said the administration will continue to provide support to local authorities as the investigation into the shootings uncovers what happened. An&nbsp;intensive manhunt is still underway&nbsp;for suspect Robert Card, 40, who&nbsp;faces an arrest warrant&nbsp;for eight counts of murder. Police said Card should be considered armed and dangerous, urging residents to shelter in place and report any suspicious activity to authorities. Harris noted that, in the United States,&nbsp;firearm deaths are the leading cause of death for children, warning, “Gun violence has terrorized and traumatized so many of our communities in this country.”&nbsp; Firearms accounted for nearly 19% of childhood deaths (ages 1-18) in 2021,&nbsp;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder database. “And let us be clear, it does not have to be this way — as our friends in Australia have demonstrated,” Harris added. Australia has long been referenced in the ongoing debate over how to stop mass shootings in the US. It passed nationwide gun control in 2006 after a lone gunman in Tasmania killed 20 people with his first 29 bullets, all in the span of 90 seconds. In a written statement later Thursday, Harris&nbsp;cited the newly-formed White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention as a way the Biden administration "will continue to work to save lives" until legislation is passed., On Friday, Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, was scheduled to host inauguration celebrations for its new president, Garry W.

Police are still searching for the suspect, Robert Card, 40, who is facing an arrest warrant for eight counts of murder, Maine State Police Col. William Ross said during a Thursday news conference. The suspect's brother, Ryan Card, said in a text message to CNN that the family has "helped law enforcement in anyway possible" and that they are urging Robert to turn himself in. He would not tell CNN if his brother has responded to the family’s requests.&nbsp; "The police have been given anything that we can offer to facilitate their efforts," he said, adding that “there are many people hurting out there, please focus on them … this is many people’s worst nightmare.”, The suspect in the Maine mass shooting is a skilled marksman and outdoorsman who was among the best shooters in his Army Reserve unit, a former colleague in the unit told CNN.&nbsp; Robert Card, who police are searching for in connection with the fatal shooting of at least 18 people in Lewiston, Maine, previously reported mental health issues and hearing voices and threatened to shoot up a National Guard base in the state, Maine law enforcement officials said.&nbsp;&nbsp; The officials also said Card was reported to have been committed to a mental health facility for two weeks over the summer.&nbsp; Card’s sister-in-law, Katie O’Neill, said in a brief conversation with CNN Thursday that Card does not have a long history of mental health struggles.&nbsp; “This is something that was an acute episode. This is not who he is,” O’Neill said. “He is not someone who has had mental health issues for his lifetime or anything like that.”&nbsp;&nbsp; The 40-year-old Card is a petroleum supply specialist in the Army Reserve and first enlisted in 2002, according to records provided by the Army on Thursday. He has no combat deployments, according to the records.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clifford Steeves of Massachusetts told CNN he knew Card when they served in the Army Reserve together, starting in the early 2000s until about a decade ago. He said he never witnessed any concerning behavior from Card.&nbsp; “He was a very nice guy — very quiet. He never overused his authority or was mean or rude to other soldiers,” Steeves said. “It’s really upsetting.”&nbsp; Steeves said the two served together around the country at different points, including in Wisconsin, Georgia and New York. He said he felt as though he “grew up” with Card because they entered the Army as young men and trained together.&nbsp;&nbsp; Steeves said that while “aggressive leadership was very prominent” in the Army, Card stuck out for being a “rational, understanding person” who “led through respect rather than fear.”&nbsp; Steeves said Card never saw combat but had extensive training, including firearms training and land navigation, “so he would be very comfortable in the woods.” He described Card as an “outdoors type of guy” and a skilled marksman who was one of the best shooters in his unit.&nbsp; Another former Army Reserve member who served with Card also described him as a “nice guy” who “never had an issue with anybody.” The servicemember, who asked to speak anonymously due to the sensitivity of the situation, did not recall Card showing any kind of violent behavior., GOP Sen.

The help included "approximately 100 team members" who were off-duty but came in to the hospital to help care for patients arriving from the scene of the shootings, Dr. John Alexander, the chief medical officer at Central Maine Medical Center, said in a news conference Thursday. The off-duty workers also helped treat people who were already in the hospital when it faced a sudden uptick in demand for trauma care. Nurses and physicians from other area hospitals joined the emergency response, along with ambulance services from other counties, Alexander said. At one point, Central Maine Medical Center had as many as 10 ambulance crews standing by outside the hospital's trauma center to ensure it could transfer any patients needed, according to Alexander. Nearby Boston and Dartmouth medical centers contributed extra helicopter services. "We were able to organize those resources and use them effectively," Alexander said of the sudden flood of support. CNN had reported Wednesday night that Central Maine Medical Center was calling in any available off-duty staff, according to Lewiston City Councilor Robert McCarthy., Two of Maine’s leading&nbsp;banks have shut down branches around Lewiston while a third has moved to shut down all branches throughout the state, as the manhunt for a mass shooter continues.

We will continue to be there every step of the way," he added. Noting that "countless" Americans have survived gun violence, he said it is "not normal, and we cannot accept it," adding that actions taken so far on gun safety are "simply not enough." "I urge Republican lawmakers in Congress to fulfill their duty to protect the American people. Work with us to pass a bill banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, to enact universal background checks, to require safe storage of guns, and end immunity from liability for gun manufacturers. This is the very least we owe every American who will now bear the scars — physical and mental — of this latest attack," Biden said., Robert Card, the suspect in Wednesday's shooting rampage, is facing eight counts of murder, Maine State Police Col.

The nonprofit and CNN define mass shootings as those in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter. Nearly 1 in 5 US adults have had a family member killed by a gun, including homicides and suicides, according to a 2023 survey from KFF (formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation). About the same proportion of adults have been personally threatened with a gun, and about 1 in 6 adults has witnessed an injury from a shooting, the survey found. More background: The FBI defines “mass murder” as the murder of four or more people and tracks “active shooter incidents,” but there is no federal or agreed-upon definition for a mass shooting. For all its data background, the Gun Violence Archive’s work is, at its heart, basic journalism. Researchers scrape data automatically from about 7,500 law enforcement agencies, media outlets and more organizations, the executive director Mark Bryant told CNN in 2022. They then comb through the results, double-check media sources, follow up with police, and add that information to the database. Most shootings are added to the system within about 72 hours, Bryant said. CNN's Annette Choi, Eric Levenson and Curt Merrill contributed reporting to this report., Residents of Bowdoin, Maine, were advised not to go outside early Thursday as the search continues for a person of interest in a deadly mass shooting in nearby Lewiston.

A father who rushed to be with his son at the mall described the horror that awaited him there.\nPolice killed the gunman: An officer was already at the mall for an unrelated call when the gunfire broke out, the Allen police chief said Saturday. The officer followed the sound of gunshots, tracked down the shooter and killed him, according to the chief.\nThe shooter's background: The gunman, who dressed in tactical gear, has been identified as 33-year-old Mauricio Garcia, a senior law enforcement source told CNN. Garcia had been living in some kind of temporary housing in the Dallas area, the source said. He used to work as a security guard and had received firearms training in that role, according to an official database.\nThe gunman's weapons: The shooter was armed with an&nbsp;AR-15 style rifle and had at least one other weapon on him when he was gunned down by police, a senior law enforcement source told CNN. Police also found multiple weapons in his car.\nPotential extremist ties: Authorities are investigating whether the shooter&nbsp;was motivated by right-wing extremism, a senior law enforcement source said. Authorities have not zeroed in on a specific motive, but the source said the shooter was found with an insignia on his clothing that read "RWDS" — an acronym known to watch groups — potentially standing for "Right Wing Death Squad." He also had an extensive social media presence that included neo-Nazi and White supremacist-related posts, according to the official.\nWhat we're still waiting for: More word directly from Texas officials. Authorities did not hold an official news conference Sunday, and have released little information about their investigation. The&nbsp;FBI&nbsp;told CNN Sunday the&nbsp;Texas Department of Public Safety is the lead agency in the mass shooting investigation., Editor’s Note:&nbsp;This post contains graphic descriptions of the shooting’s aftermath. A veteran and former police officer described the haunting scenes he found when he arrived at the outlet mall in Allen, Texas, Saturday. The aftermath of the mass shooting there was “horrific,” Steven Spainhouer told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield on Sunday. The former Army officer said he wouldn’t wish it upon anyone to see or experience what he did. Spainhouer said he was planning to meet his son, who works at the H&amp;M store at the outlet mall, for lunch. His son called to tell him about the active shooter and that he was sheltered in the break room at the store. Spainhouer drove to the outlet mall and said when he showed up, he saw many people fleeing the scene and counted seven bodies on the ground. He rushed up to different victims to check for a pulse, and said he witnessed one woman who had “nothing left of her face or head, it was gone.” Spainhouer performed chest compressions on another victim, who coughed up blood and then died, he told CNN. Then he saw a young child who crawled out from underneath one of the victims and was “caked with blood from head to toe,” Spainhouer said. The child kept saying that his mother was hurt. The father, who has personal and professional experience handling firearms, said the horror he found at the mall will repeat itself if lawmakers don't limit the access of certain weapons to the public. Spainhouer added that both he and his son will receive counseling for what they witnessed Saturday. Allen police subsequently disputed parts of Spainhouer's account, noting "inconsistencies" between his media interviews and the facts of the investigation. The department said it conducted a follow-up interview with Spainhouer and "determined that [he] is not a credible incident witness." According to the police department, Spainhouer did not perform CPR, and did not move a deceased mother who was covering a child who survived the shooting. In response, Spainhouer stood by his account, said he was "hurt and disappointed," and clarified that "a small child pulled himself from under a victim and I assisted him to a safe space away from the area." This article was updated on May 16 to reflect the Allen Police Department's statement disputing parts of Steven Spainhouer's eyewitness account — and Spainhouer's response to the police press release., Authorities are investigating whether the Allen, Texas, outlet mall shooter was motivated by right-wing extremism, a senior law enforcement source familiar with the investigation tells CNN. While the investigation remains ongoing and authorities have not zeroed in on a specific motive, the source said the deceased shooter was found with an insignia on his clothing that read "RWDS," which authorities believe may stand for "Right Wing Death Squad." As the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that monitors and reports on extremism, has noted in the past, some members of extremist groups have been seen in recent years with patches bearing the same letters. Investigators have also uncovered the gunman's extensive social media presence, the law enforcement source tells CNN. It includes neo-Nazi and White supremacist-related posts, and images that authorities believe he shared online, according to the official., A local mental health group is offering free counseling to the residents of Collin County, Texas, following Saturday’s shooting at a Dallas-area outlet mall. Lifepath Systems will offer free counseling to those affected by the shooting, working with law enforcement, the Texas Department of Public Safety, and Texas Health and Human Services, it said in a statement. Lifepath System works as a unit of local government and a not-for-profit center,&nbsp;according to its website., Mauricio Garcia — the 33-year-old who has been identified as the gunman in the Allen, Texas, outlet mall shooting, according to a senior law enforcement source —&nbsp;received firearms training for part of his work as a security officer, according to an official database. Garcia was approved to work as a commissioned security guard in Texas from April 2016 until April 2020, when his license expired, according to the Texas Online Private Security database, maintained by the Texas Department of Public Safety. His profile shows he worked for at least three security companies. None of those companies immediately responded to requests for comment.&nbsp; According to the database, Garcia received&nbsp;Level II&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;Level III&nbsp;security training. The former covers security laws in Texas; the latter, which is required for all commissioned security officers in Texas, includes firearm training and the demonstration of firearm proficiency, according to&nbsp;Jonah Nathan, vice president of Ranger Guard, a security guard service in Texas not affiliated with Garcia’s employers. In 2018,&nbsp;Garcia also completed a separate&nbsp;firearms proficiency&nbsp;training course, which requires six hours of continuing education, according to the Texas DPS database.&nbsp; Private security guards in Texas undergo background checks and are disqualified if they have committed certain crimes, such as assault, burglary or sexual offenses, among others, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety&nbsp;website&nbsp;and&nbsp;state codes. They are also disqualified if they have been dishonorably discharged from the US military; have been found incompetent by a court of law; or have been required to register as a sex offender.&nbsp;It’s unclear why Garcia’s license expired. A police officer killed the gunman outside the outlet mall after he carried out the massacre Saturday, according to the Allen police chief. The shooting left at least least eight people dead and seven others wounded., The National Hockey League’s Dallas Stars have canceled Sunday’s playoff game watch party "out of respect for the victims" of the mall shooting in Allen, Texas., At least four patients injured in Saturday's mass shooting in Allen, Texas,&nbsp;are being treated at&nbsp;Medical City McKinney hospital near the Dallas suburb, police said in a news release Sunday. One patient is in fair condition while the other three are in critical condition, the Allen Police Department&nbsp;said.&nbsp; Allen Fire Chief Jonathan Boyd said Saturday that at least nine shooting victims went to area hospitals after the shooting, two of whom succumbed to their injuries. One wounded individual was transferred to&nbsp;Medical City Plano and is&nbsp;in fair condition, according to the Sunday release.&nbsp;Another individual was&nbsp;sent to Medical City Children’s Hospital and is in fair condition, the police department said. The age of the patient sent to&nbsp;Medical City Children’s Hospital has not been released, but officials have earlier said that the victims ranged in age from 5 to 61. The seventh surviving patient “was&nbsp;treated at a different area hospital," the release added.&nbsp;&nbsp; The shooting left at least eight people dead, according to local officials, and a police officer also killed the gunman outside the mall., The gunman in Saturday's mass shooting in Allen, Texas, has been identified as Mauricio Garcia, 33, a senior law enforcement source familiar with the investigation tells CNN's Josh Campbell.&nbsp; In addition to the AR-15 style weapon found near him, Garcia had at least one other weapon on him when he was fatally shot in front of the mall, the source tells CNN. Police also found multiple weapons in his car. CNN talked with neighbors who witnessed FBI and police at a home with an address matching that of Garcia's parents Saturday night. Authorities arrived there about an hour after the shooting and blocked off the street for several hours, neighbors told CNN's Ed Lavandera Garcia had been living in some form of temporary housing, according to the senior law enforcement source.&nbsp;The Dallas Morning News reports the suspect had been staying in an extended-stay hotel in Dallas., The gunman who killed eight people at an Allen, Texas, outlet mall used an AR-15 style weapon, President Joe Biden said in a statement Sunday. As previously reported, a photo from the scene obtained by CNN showed the suspected gunman dead on the ground near an AR-15 style rifle, armed with several extra magazines on his body., A Texas state senator whose district includes&nbsp;Uvalde&nbsp;blasted inaction on gun control by the state's Republican leadership in the wake of&nbsp;Saturday's mass shooting in Allen, calling it a “Texas nightmare.” "It's a nightmare that they created. It's a chaos that they created," Democratic state Sen. Roland Gutierrez told CNN’s Jake Tapper Sunday. On Saturday, Gutierrez had&nbsp;tweeted:&nbsp;“There is a special place in hell for people who watch all this happen and choose to do nothing,” along with the hashtag: “#bloodontheirhands.” Gutierrez has been&nbsp;outspoken&nbsp;in the wake of the deadly mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, which left 19 students and two teachers dead. CNN's Ed Lavandera,&nbsp;Elizabeth Wolfe&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sharif Paget contributed to this report., The FBI is asking witnesses who have digital evidence from Saturday's outlet mall shooting to submit information to an online portal created in the wake of the mass shooting.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Texas Department of Public Safety is the lead agency in the shooting investigation, the FBI told CNN Sunday. The bureau confirmed it "was present at two locations in Dallas," and is helping state and local police by "devoting all available resources to include investigative, intelligence, digital forensics, and victim services personnel among others." Allen is a suburb of Dallas located about 25 miles north of the city. Officials have released little information about their investigation into the massacre —&nbsp;including any potential motive. The shooting left at least eight people dead and seven more wounded., President Joe Biden again urged Congress to pass legislation banning assault weapons and enacting universal background checks in a statement reacting to the mass shooting&nbsp;in Allen, Texas. The president's statement also lists children among those killed. CNN has not independently confirmed whether&nbsp;children&nbsp;were among the dead,&nbsp;but CNN did report&nbsp;young children&nbsp;were being treated at the hospital. "Once again I ask Congress to send me a bill banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Enacting universal background checks. Requiring safe storage. Ending immunity for gun manufacturers. I will sign it immediately. We need nothing less to keep our streets safe," he added. Biden said yesterday's violence "is too shocking to be so familiar."&nbsp; He also said he is grateful for the first responders on the scene, and that he has directed federal agencies to provide support to local officials as needed.&nbsp; Biden ordered flags at the White House and other federal buildings to half-staff to honor the victims through May 11.&nbsp; News of the shooting emerged yesterday evening as Biden headed to church. As he left the church, he told reporters who asked about the shooting that he was "unaware" of the situation. The President was later briefed that night when he returned to the White House., Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas says he has spoken to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Allen Mayor Ken&nbsp;Fulk after Saturday's deadly shooting outside an outlet mall. Mayorkas declined to provide information about the shooter. “I think it's under investigation. The state and local authorities are leading that investigation,” he said., President Joe Biden has&nbsp;issued a proclamation honoring the victims of the mass shooting in Allen, Texas. Biden ordered flags lowered to half-staff at the White House, on military bases and at all public buildings until May 11., Texas Sen. Ted Cruz expressed his condolences for the victims of the mall shooting in a tweet Saturday evening.    He added that his team was in contact with local officials. Cruz also thanked "the incredible law enforcement who put a stop to the monster who committed this act of evil.", Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, told Fox News Sunday that authorities need to find answers on what exactly led up to the deadly mass shooting at an Allen, Texas, outlet mall yesterday.  "There’s always telltale signs before, there’s indicators should have looked out for," he said.  Cuellar added that strict gun control measures have not ended mass shootings in blue states around the country, arguing more needs to be done to get to the root of the issue.  Some context: The attack in Allen, Texas, is one of at least 199 mass shootings in the US this year, according to the&nbsp;Gun Violence Archive. The archive, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people have been wounded or killed, excluding a gunman. Texas has loosened restrictions on gun ownership in recent years amid several high-profile mass shootings that have devastated its communities. In 2021,&nbsp;legislation went into effect&nbsp;allowing most Texans who legally own a firearm to carry it openly in public without obtaining a permit or training. A&nbsp;2022 study&nbsp;found that states with weaker gun laws have higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides and suicides. Correction: An earlier version of this post misidentified Rep. Henry Cuellar's political party. He is a Democrat., All H&amp;M employees at the&nbsp;Allen Premium Outlets mall in Texas "are safe and accounted for," after Saturday's mass shooting, the company said in a statement to CNN Sunday. Witnesses told CNN’s Ed Lavandera that the shooter first opened fire near the popular clothing chain's store. Eight&nbsp;people were killed and at least seven others were injured when a gunman&nbsp;opened fire at the crowded mall&nbsp;Saturday afternoon, marking the latest act of gun violence to shatter an American community as they are enjoying activities in public places. The gunman was eventually killed by an Allen Police Department officer, who had been at the mall on an unrelated call, police said. Investigators believe the shooter was acting alone. CNN's Ed Lavandera,&nbsp;Elizabeth Wolfe&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sharif Paget contributed to this report., Texas Gov.&nbsp;Greg Abbott said he's traveling to Allen, Texas, Sunday to meet with the community after a gunman&nbsp;killed eight people and injured seven&nbsp;on Saturday at an outlet mall.&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll be going up to Allen later today to begin the process of providing hope and healing,"&nbsp;Abbott&nbsp;told&nbsp;Shannon Bream on "Fox News Sunday." Abbott&nbsp;reiterated&nbsp;thanks to local authorities for its "swift response," to the situation. Allen is a suburb of Dallas, located about 25 miles north of the city., The attack in Allen, Texas, is one of at least 199 mass shootings in the US this year, according to the&nbsp;Gun Violence Archive. The archive, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people have been wounded or killed, excluding a gunman. The Allen massacre is one of three mass shootings that took place on Saturday, as recorded by the archive. In the early morning hours, a shooting at a party in Chico, California, left five people injured and one dead. Additionally, a shooting in Columbus, Ohio, left at least three people injured and one dead early Saturday, according to the archive. The latest attack comes just days after a 24-year-old gunman allegedly shot one person dead at a medical facility in Atlanta and injured four others., Texas state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat whose district encompasses Uvalde, blasted politicians who refuse to enact reform measures in the wake of Saturday's massacre in Allen. Eight people were killed and at least seven others wounded when a gunman&nbsp;opened fire at the outlet mall&nbsp;Saturday afternoon, marking the latest act of gun violence to shatter an American community as they are enjoying activities in public places. The gunman was killed by an Allen Police Department officer who was at the mall on an unrelated call, police said. Investigators believe the shooter was acting alone. Gutierrez has been outspoken in the wake of the deadly mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, which left 19 students and two teachers dead. CNN's Ed Lavandera,&nbsp;Elizabeth Wolfe&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sharif Paget contributed to this report., Kimberly Blakey said she and her 14-year-old daughter were among the crowd trying to flee the parking lot of the Allen, Texas, outlet mall during the attack Saturday. In her haste to get away, Blakey initially drove toward the sound of gunshots, before her daughter told her to turn around. But as she drove toward the exit, she said, they got stuck behind a scrum of other cars trying to do the same. That’s when she felt her car get hit twice by gunfire. The pair was able to get out of the parking lot and didn’t stop until they reached home, even when Blakey realized her car’s flat-tire warning light had come on. “We were on a mission to get out of there,” she said. The shooting was deeply disturbing, said Fatburger employee Tiffany Gipson, who told CNN she and other customers hid in a hallway behind their mall restaurant. “I’ve never witnessed anything like this. This is very traumatic for me and I already suffer from anxiety and seizures,” Gipson said. CNN’s Josh Campbell, Ashley Killough, Keith Allen, Andy Rose, Paradise Afshar, John Miller, Phil Gast and Emma Tucker contributed to this report., Texas has loosened restrictions on gun ownership in recent years amid several high-profile mass shootings that have devastated its communities. Recent shootings include the massacre in Uvalde, where a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school last May.  In 2021, legislation went into effect allowing most Texans who legally own a firearm to carry it openly in public without obtaining a permit or training. A 2022 study found that states with weaker gun laws have higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides and suicides., Mayor Ken&nbsp;Fulk called the deadly shooting Saturday afternoon at an Allen, Texas, shopping mall a "tragedy" in a&nbsp;statement released in the city's latest shooting update.

Rest assured, the nation and the world are also grieving.", A vigil for the victims of the Allen, Texas, outlet mall shooting will be held at 5 p.m. CT (6 p.m ET) Sunday, according to state Rep. Jeff Leach. The vigil will be held at the Cottonwood Creek Baptist Church in Allen, a less than 10-minute drive from the Allen Premium Outlets, where a gunman killed at least eight people Saturday., As the sound of gunfire began to resonate through the Allen Premium Outlets parking lot near Dallas, panicked shoppers screamed and ducked behind rows of cars as others sprinted across the lot, one witness video shows. Inside the sprawling complex in suburban Allen, employees, shoppers and families with young children bolted to take cover in storage areas or back hallways, witnesses told CNN. Eight people were killed and at least seven others wounded when a gunman&nbsp;opened fire at the outlet mall&nbsp;Saturday afternoon, marking the latest act of gun violence to shatter an American community as they are enjoying activities in public places. The gunman was killed by an Allen Police Department officer who was at the mall on an unrelated call, police said. Investigators believe the shooter was acting alone. A photo obtained by CNN shows what appears to be the gunman lying on the ground after being shot, with an AR-15-style firearm nearby. He is clad in black body armor and appears to have several extra magazines strapped in his chest gear. At least nine people were rushed to trauma facilities, two of whom have since died, Allen Fire Chief Jonathan Boyd said.

<p>If we want to keep analyzing in R we have multiple options. I would refer you to the great book <em>‘Text Mining with R’</em>. Let’s use the <code>tidytext</code> and <code>textdata</code> packages to do a simple sentiment analysis. First we need to shape our data accoringly.</p>

<p>You might have noticed the issue with the reverse naming of document and word. For some reason there happens a switch in the <code>LDA()</code> step, that I was unable to diagnose, so this is my shoddy workaround. Now that we have the model we can look how certain terms are present in the models 12 topics. Remember that the topics were set by the model itself and not by us. Therefor we can evaluate if the topic are sensible to our human preferences.</p>

<p>We are mostly interested in plot nr. 11 that is showing the language used during the reporting on the Prague mass shooting. To my sensibilities the graph make sense and so I will continue with the analysis. To determine whether the Prague shooting was a routing reporting experience for the writers at CNN we can look whether the articles themselves are significantly different. For that purpose we will separate the individual articles from their Events and look how many the model can correctly allocate to the correct topic.</p>

<p>Looking at the graph we can clearly see that there are 3 Events with significantly lower mis- attribution of articles/headlines they are: The Farmington New Mexico shooting, the judgment against Jennifer Crumbley and the Prague university shooting.</p>
<p>The uniqueness of these three events is understandable; the shooting in Farmington was unique in the age of its victims (73-97) and the method of its perpetrator, the case against Jenifer Crumbley was poised to set a precedent in the USA (by now it has set it already) and the shooting in Prague has shown the danger of exporting the motivations and conditions of mass shooting from the USA into other countries with similar cultural contexts.</p>
