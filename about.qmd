Hello, I am Matyáš Levínský a sociology student at the philosophical faculty of the Charles University in Prague. I am primarily interested in the precarization of work due to the Gig economy, and AI. I try to follow hot topics, and as such am interested in AI itself.

Since 2022 I am working at [PAQ Research](https://www.paqresearch.cz/) as a Data Analyst. You may find my entire CV [here](cv.qmd).
