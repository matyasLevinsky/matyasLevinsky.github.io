Read with caution if you are sensitive to that.\n:::\n\nGiven that the University shooting that happened on the 21 December 2023 was unprecedented in Czech history, I wondered whether it would be reflected as such in american media that has grown increasingly desensitized to news of mass shootings.\n\n#### Resources used\n\nI used the web-scraping tutorial provided by [renatatopinkova](https://renatatopinkova.github.io/) and the book [*Text Mining with R*](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) by [Julia Silge](https://juliasilge.com/) and [David Robinson](https://www.rstudio.com/authors/david-robinson/). ChatGPT-4 and its internal module R-Guru were used for troubleshooting.\n\n## Getting the data\n\nI wanted to compare the mass shooting to comparable reporting about mass shootings using the same live-block format CNN used for the Prague shooting. I used the first 12 articles that popped up for the Google search *'site:cnn.com \"mass shooting\" live-news'* and filtering for articles in 2023-2024.\n\nI created a list of the necessary URLs and a couple of helper functions: `readUrlList`, `parseUrlList` and `generateTeiCorpus`. They are simple for-loops that do what their name suggest. Let's load them together with the packages we will need.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(jsonlite)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(here)\nsource(here(\"helperCNNAnalysis.R\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we can use them to read and parse the HTML of the CNN live-blogs. This may take some time so lets save it for later. If the code should be broken I have provided my own webscrape from 28.02.2024.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhtmlList <- readUrlList(urlList, silent = T)\nparsedDt <- parseUrlList(htmlList, silent = T)\nsaveRDS(parsedDt, file = \"parsedDt_WebscrapingCNN.rds\")\nparsedDt\n```\n:::\n\n\nAlternative:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nparsedDt <- readRDS(here(\"parsedDt_WebscrapingCNN.rds\"))\nparsedDt\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"@context\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"@type\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"mainEntityOfPage\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"df[,2]\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"headline\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"description\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"url\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"datePublished\"],\"name\":[7],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"coverageStartTime\"],\"name\":[8],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"dateModified\"],\"name\":[9],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"coverageEndTime\"],\"name\":[10],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"publisher\"],\"name\":[11],\"type\":[\"df[,3]\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"image\"],\"name\":[12],\"type\":[\"df[,4]\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"author\"],\"name\":[13],\"type\":[\"df[,2]\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"about\"],\"name\":[14],\"type\":[\"df[,2]\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"liveBlogUpdate\"],\"name\":[15],\"type\":[\"list\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"http://schema.org\",\"2\":\"LiveBlogPosting\",\"3\":\"<df[,2] [13 × 2]>\",\"4\":\"Live updates: Prague mass shooting at Charles University\",\"5\":\"A shooting at a university in Prague on Thursday has left more than a dozen people dead and over 20 injured, according to Czech authorities.\",\"6\":\"https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/prague-shooting-charles-university-12-21-23/index.html\",\"7\":\"2023-12-21T16:21:51Z\",\"8\":\"2023-12-21T16:21:51Z\",\"9\":\"2023-12-21T23:05:55Z\",\"10\":\"2023-12-22T16:21:51Z\",\"11\":\"<df[,3] [13 × 3]>\",\"12\":\"<df[,4] [13 × 4]>\",\"13\":\"<df[,2] [13 × 2]>\",\"14\":\"<df[,2] [13 × 2]>\",\"15\":\"<df[,10] [19 × 10]>\"},{\"1\":\"http://schema.org\",\"2\":\"LiveBlogPosting\",\"3\":\"<df[,2] [13 × 2]>\",\"4\":\"October 25, 2023 - Lewiston, Maine mass shootings\",\"5\":\"A manhunt is underway after a shooting rampage occurred in Lewiston, Maine, on Wednesday night, according to multiple law enforcement sources.

The attack at Charles University came after authorities received some prior warning about a student at the school, according to the country's head of police, though an investigation into key details of the shooting is just beginning. Here's what we know so far: The attack had a devastating toll: At least 14 people were killed and 25 others wounded, according to the latest update provided by police. Authorities revised the number of those killed and hurt in the attack as their investigation unfolded and victims received treatment at hospitals. At least 10 of those wounded are in serious condition, officials said. The victims were gunned down at Charles University, located in the busy tourist center of Prague.\\\\nThe shooter is dead: Early reports indicate the shooter took his own life after the attack, but that is not yet confirmed, Czech Police President Martin Vondrášek said in a news conference. The shooter has not been formally identified because of the severity of his injuries, the police chief said, but investigators believe they know his identity. The suspect is a 24-year-old philosophy student at the school who had a gun permit and several weapons, Vondrášek said.\\\\nPolice were tipped off about the suspect: Authorities received a tip saying the suspect was traveling from his hometown of Hostouň to Prague intending to take his own life, police said. Shortly after that, they learned that a man believed to be the suspect's father was found dead in Hostouň, which is about 100 miles from the Czech capital.\\\\nOfficials had evacuated a different school building: Police were aware the suspected shooter had a lecture at 2 p.m. CET (8 a.m. ET) Thursday and had evacuated the building where the lecture was meant to take place, Vondrášek said. But then police received a call about a shooting in a different building on campus, according to the police chief.\\\\nStudents scrambled to escape the gunfire: Police said it took time to help students safely evacuate after the shooting, as some had locked themselves in classrooms. A group of students climbed out of a classroom window and hid on the ledge of the university's Faculty of Arts building in an attempt to escape, a photo on social media showed.\\\\nOfficials expressed shock at the violence: Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala expressed his condolences to the loved ones of the victims and said there was \\\"absolutely no explanation, no justification\\\" for the \\\"senseless attack.\\\" He said it was believed to be an isolated incident and not an act of terror or attack by an organized group.

Moments later, they started pushing classroom furniture up to the door to create a barricade. \\\"About five minutes after that, someone tried to open the door very violently,\\\" Weizman said. He believes it may have been the shooter, but he does not know for sure.

This is not who he is,” O’Neill said. “He is not someone who has had mental health issues for his lifetime or anything like that.”   The 40-year-old Card is a petroleum supply specialist in the Army Reserve and first enlisted in 2002, according to records provided by the Army on Thursday. He has no combat deployments, according to the records.   Clifford Steeves of Massachusetts told CNN he knew Card when they served in the Army Reserve together, starting in the early 2000s until about a decade ago. He said he never witnessed any concerning behavior from Card.  “He was a very nice guy — very quiet. He never overused his authority or was mean or rude to other soldiers,” Steeves said. “It’s really upsetting.”  Steeves said the two served together around the country at different points, including in Wisconsin, Georgia and New York. He said he felt as though he “grew up” with Card because they entered the Army as young men and trained together.   Steeves said that while “aggressive leadership was very prominent” in the Army, Card stuck out for being a “rational, understanding person” who “led through respect rather than fear.”  Steeves said Card never saw combat but had extensive training, including firearms training and land navigation, “so he would be very comfortable in the woods.” He described Card as an “outdoors type of guy” and a skilled marksman who was one of the best shooters in his unit.  Another former Army Reserve member who served with Card also described him as a “nice guy” who “never had an issue with anybody.” The servicemember, who asked to speak anonymously due to the sensitivity of the situation, did not recall Card showing any kind of violent behavior.\"},{\"1\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"2\":\"October 25, 2023 - Lewiston, Maine mass shootings\",\"3\":\"A manhunt is underway after a shooting rampage occurred in Lewiston, Maine, on Wednesday night, according to multiple law enforcement sources.

The nonprofit and CNN define mass shootings as those in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter. Nearly 1 in 5 US adults have had a family member killed by a gun, including homicides and suicides, according to a 2023 survey from KFF (formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation). About the same proportion of adults have been personally threatened with a gun, and about 1 in 6 adults has witnessed an injury from a shooting, the survey found. More background: The FBI defines “mass murder” as the murder of four or more people and tracks “active shooter incidents,” but there is no federal or agreed-upon definition for a mass shooting. For all its data background, the Gun Violence Archive’s work is, at its heart, basic journalism. Researchers scrape data automatically from about 7,500 law enforcement agencies, media outlets and more organizations, the executive director Mark Bryant told CNN in 2022. They then comb through the results, double-check media sources, follow up with police, and add that information to the database. Most shootings are added to the system within about 72 hours, Bryant said.

He described hearing more about what unfolded Wednesday night from eyewitnesses at the reunification center, including one man who was playing the lawn game cornhole when he heard \\\"a couple pops ... but didn't think anything of it, it is Halloween. Then he started seeing everybody scream and move.\\\" Authorities across Maine are involved in the ongoing manhunt, with 40-year-old Robert Card identified as a person of interest.

The shooter strode through the neighborhood in this commercial hub near the Southwest’s Four Corners and “randomly fired at whatever entered his head to shoot at,” including houses and cars, before police arrived and fatally shot him, he said Monday night. In his arsenal was an AR-15-style rifle – a weapon of choice among US mass shooters in recent, high-profile massacres, including the 2012 Sandy Hook school attack and a shooting in Uvalde, Texas, nearly a year ago that left 19 children and two teachers dead.\"},{\"1\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"2\":\"March 27, 2023 Nashville Covenant School shooting news\",\"3\":\"A shooter fatally shot three students and three adults at a private Christian school in Nashville, authorities said.

If you are just reading in, here's the latest on the shooting and investigation:  The shooter: The person was identified as 28-year-old Audrey Hale. Hale was shot and killed by police during the Monday attack, and left behind “drawn out” maps of the Covenant School detailing “how this was all going to take place,” Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake said. As police work to piece together what led up to the violence, officials said they had determined where the shooter lived in the Nashville area and have interviewed Hale’s father.  Hale, who attended the Christian school years ago, left writings that pertain to the shooting and had scouted a second possible attack location in Nashville, “but because of a threat assessment by the suspect – there’s too much security – they decided not to,” police chief said.The writings revealed that the attack at Covenant School “was calculated and planned,” Metro Nashville said. So far, little is known about the shooter. Hale graduated from Nossi College of Art & Design in Nashville last year, the president of the school confirmed to CNN, and a LinkedIn profile says Hale worked as a freelance graphic designer and a part-time grocery shopper. Police have referred to Hale as the “female shooter” and at an evening press conference added that Hale was transgender. When asked for clarification, a spokesperson told CNN Hale used “male pronouns” on a social media profile. The weapons: The shooter was “someone that had multiple rounds of ammunition, prepared for confrontation with law enforcement, prepared to do more harm than was actually done,” the police chief said in a news conference. Three weapons – an AR-style rifle, an AR-style pistol and a handgun – were found and police believe Hale obtained at least two of the weapons legally, Drake said. A search warrant executed at Hale’s home also resulted in the seizure of a sawed-off shotgun, a second shotgun and other evidence, according to police. The victims: All three students shot and killed were 9 years old. They were identified as Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney. Three adults killed in the shooting were identified as 61-year-old Cynthia Peak, 60-year-old Katherine Koonce and 61-year-old Mike Hill, police said. Two Covenant School employees are among the victims of Monday’s mass shooting, according to the school. What is expected to happen today: Investigators were expected to spend Tuesday processing the scene and gathering more details about what happened during the roughly 14 minutes of terror at the elementary school. Mass shootings in America: The attack marked the 19th shooting at a school or university so far in 2023 in which at least one person was wounded, according to a CNN tally. With six victims, the shooting at Covenant is the deadliest school shooting since the attack in Uvalde, Texas, last May left 21 people dead.

A human chain of children, hand-in-hand, shepherded by police officers, fled the latest school struck by unfathomable tragedy. On Monday, it was Nashville’s turn to join the roster of cities made notorious by a mass shooting epidemic much of the country seems prepared to tacitly accept as the price of the right to own high-powered firearms.  The reality of what unfolded inside was inhuman, but it can unfortunately be imagined given the gruesome insider accounts that emerged from previous school shootings — in Uvalde, Texas, last year, or at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut in 2012. Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney, all 9 years old, were gunned down by a shooter armed with two AR-style weapons and a handgun, two of which police said were bought legally. Their names — known only to the rest of America in death — were released by police about the same time as they should have been going home from Covenant School for the day. Three staff, all half a century older, also died. They were Cynthia Peak, 61, Katherine Koonce, 60, and Mike Hill, 61. They were all murdered in the place that should be the safest: where kids go to school. But a plague of recent classroom rampages, distinguished even among America’s gun violence by their depravity, shows that nowhere is really secure.

The students who were killed were all 9 years old, police said. The shooter, who was identified as a 28-year-old former student of the school, was also killed in a shootout with police. Here's what we know so far: About Covenant School: The school is a private Christian school founded in 2001 as a ministry of Covenant Presbyterian Church. It has an average enrollment of about 200 people in recent years, according to its website, and it teaches preschool through 6th grade.\\\\nWhat happened: Don Aaron, spokesperson for the Metro Nashville Police Department, said the first calls of an active shooting came in at around 10:15 a.m. local time. When officers arrived, they went through the first level of the building, he said. They then heard gunshots coming from the second level of the building, according to Aaron. He said that's where police confronted and killed the shooter at 10:27 a.m. local time.\\\\nThe shooter: The shooter has been identified as 28-year-old Nashville resident Audrey Hale. The shooter was armed with a handgun and two AR-style weapons — one a rifle and an AR-style pistol, Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake said. Two of those may have been obtained legally and locally in Nashville, Drake said. According to initial findings, the shooter was once a student at the school, he added, though he said police are unsure what years. \\\\nPrior planning: The shooter had drawn detailed maps of Covenant School, Drake said, including the entry points to the building and detailing \\\"how this was all gonna take place.\\\" Drake said police believe the shooter shot through one of the doors to get into the school. Drake said the school was the only location targeted by the shooter. Police have also located writings that they are reviewing.\\\\nThe victims: The three students who were shot and killed at Covenant School were all 9 years old, police said. They have been identified as Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney, according to police. Three adults were also killed in the shooting. They have been identified as 61-year-old Cynthia Peak, 60-year-old Katherine Koonce and 61-year-old Mike Hill, police said.\\\\nWhat's next: Police will spend the next two days processing the scene and working to gather more details about what happened during a shooting at a Nashville elementary school, Aaron said, adding police also intend to release video soon. Officials said they knew where the shooter lived and they have interviewed the shooter's father.\\\\nCall for gun safety legislation: President Joe Biden called the shooting at a Nashville school \\\"heartbreaking, a family's worst nightmare,\\\" while advocating for gun reform. Biden said Congress needs to pass an assault weapons ban because we \\\"need to do more to protect our schools.\\\" However, a bipartisan solution is extremely unlikely this Congress with a slim Democratic majority in the Senate and a GOP-led House. Nashville Mayor John Cooper said too many children are dying from guns and that the community needs to come together to support each other.\\\\nMass shootings in America: There have been at least 130 mass shooting in the US so far in 2023, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive. The Gun Violence Archive, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.\"},{\"1\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"2\":\"March 27, 2023 Nashville Covenant School shooting news\",\"3\":\"A shooter fatally shot three students and three adults at a private Christian school in Nashville, authorities said.

The shooting took place at the Covenant School, a private Christian elementary school in Nashville that teaches preschool through 6th grade, Nashville police said.  Officials said the shooter was armed with at least two \\\"assault-type\\\" rifles and a handgun. Biden called on Congress to pass an assault weapons ban, saying we \\\"need to do more to protect our schools.\\\" “It's about time we began to make some more progress,\\\" he said. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, a Democrat, echoed the president’s remarks, saying he strongly supports \\\"bills to ban assault weapons from civilian use and to close gaps in our background check system.” He urged lawmakers to come up with a bipartisan solution, but that is extremely unlikely this Congress with a slim Democratic majority in the Senate and a GOP-led House. Last year the Senate passed the “Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,” the first major piece of legislation to address gun violence since 1994. The legislation fell short of what some Democrats had hoped for, including their long hope of banning assault weapons.

The shooting left one person dead and more than 20 injured. This is everything we know so far: Shooting in large crowd: An estimated 1 million people gathered Wednesday just steps from Union Station in Kansas City for the parade and rally to mark the Chiefs’ repeat championship win, with players still on the stage when the chaos erupted. A victory rally following the parade featured several players toasting the team’s connection with the city. The event wrapped up, and then, gunshots rang out.\\\\nPolice investigation: Police now are collecting physical and digital evidence and interviewing witnesses and victims, Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said. The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives both responded to Kansas City to help police, a Justice Department spokesperson said. The FBI has set up a website asking for tips or videos.\\\\nThree detained: Three people were detained and an unspecified number of guns recovered as officers converged, said Graves. No charges have been announced and no suspects have been named. “We do not have a motive, but we are asking those who may potentially have any kind of information, a witness or video, to contact police,” the chief said at a Wednesday news conference. A rally attendee, Paul Contreras, told CNN that he tackled someone, knocking a gun to the ground. Police arrived at the scene and handcuffed the person pinned to the ground, video shows. It’s unclear if the person who was tackled was among those police said they detained.   The victims: Graves said during a news conference Wednesday that 22 people were shot in the incident, one of whom died from their injuries.

He said the shooter went to the bank's front lobby \\\"after assaulting the victims in the office area.\\\" Footage from Galloway's body camera shows police talking about how they can’t see the shooter and that he is shooting through windows. “Shooter has an angle on that officer!” one officer can be heard saying. “We got to get up there!” he adds. Galloway was Wilt's training officer, according to Humphrey.\\\\nOfficer Nickolas Wilt: The newly sworn-in officer was shown in body camera footage going back into the line of fire to protect other people, Humphrey said. He said since he was new, he was acting based on \\\"his training and his character\\\" and that he \\\"never hesitates.\\\" Wilt was shot in the head and is still in critical condition at the hospital, officials said. \\\\nWhat happened next: While police attempted to rescue Wilt after he was shot, Galloway's body camera shows the suspect shooting at them \\\"trying to kill them in their process of trying to save Officer Wilt,” Humphrey said. The gunfire broke the bank windows, allowing Galloway to find a vantage point to see where the gunman was located, Humphrey said. This is when Galloway kills the shooter, the deputy chief said. Galloway suffered a minor gunshot wound.\\\\nBystander video: Another video showed a recording taken by someone in a building across the street. You can see an officer outside the bank.\\\\nBefore police arrived: In addition to the surveillance footage, CNN reported that the shooter, identified as a 25-year-old bank employee, live-streamed the attack on Instagram.

A city official said investigators are in possession of the video.\\\\nDispatcher audio: A Louisville Metro Police dispatcher said in an audio that the gunman had left a voicemail saying he was going to kill everyone at the bank. \\\"He's texted a friend, called a friend, left a voicemail saying he's gonna kill everyone at the bank. Feeling suicidal,\\\" the dispatcher said, according to Broadcastify audio.\\\\nVictims: The five victims were identified as Joshua Barrick, 40; Juliana Farmer, 45; Tommy Elliott, 63; James Tutt, 64, and Deana Eckert, 57. \\\\nHospital response: Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer, said his hospital used 170 units of blood on Monday to treat victims from the bank shooting. He credited the Red Cross and blood donations with saving lives. On Tuesday, four patients were still at the University of Louisville Hospital, a spokesperson said. The rookie officer who was shot in the head remains sedated in the intensive care unit, Smith said.\\\\nCalls for action: Greenberg said that 40 people have now been killed by guns this year in his city, and he made a plea for the state and federal governments to take action on gun violence or to cede that power to the city. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat from Kentucky, called for Republicans to pass gun reform policies saying that the issue is not political. Smith said having to treat so many victims of gun violence, day in and day out, has made him grow \\\"weary.\\\"\\\\nVigil planned: A local vigil will be held Wednesday at 5 p.m. ET at the Muhammad Ali Center to honor the victims of the shooting and unite as a community, the mayor said.\"},{\"1\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"2\":\"April 11, 2023 - The latest on the Louisville bank shooting\",\"3\":\"Louisville police have released bodycam footage showing the tense police confrontation with the gunman who shot multiple people at a bank on Monday, leaving at least five dead.\",\"4\":\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/louisville-kentucky-shooting-04-11-23/index.html\",\"5\":\"2023-04-11T11:29:25Z\",\"6\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"7\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"8\":\"BlogPosting\",\"9\":\"More than half of US adults or their families have been impacted by a gun-related incident, new survey shows\",\"10\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"11\":\"A majority of adults or their family members in the United States have been affected by a gun-related incident, according to a new survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Over half of US adults, 54%, have either personally or had a family member who has been impacted by such an incident, such as witnessing a shooting, being threatened by a gun, or been injured or killed by a gun. Nearly 1 in 5 adults has had a family member killed by a gun, including in homicide and suicide. About as many adults have been personally threatened with a gun, and about 1 in 6 adults has witnessed an injury from a shooting, the survey found. The new report came less than a day after a shooter killed five people in Louisville, Kentucky. Mass shootings have escalated in recent years, reaching a record pace in 2023. There have been at least 146 incidents so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, leaving more than 200 people dead and hundreds more injured. About half of all gun-related deaths are suicides, federal data shows. And the suicide rate has also recently increased, reversing years of decline and returning to near-record levels. The vast majority of adults say they worry at least sometimes that they or someone in their family will become a victim of gun violence, the new KFF survey found. Nearly a quarter of parents of children younger than 18 say they worry about it daily or almost daily. Guns are now the leading cause of death among children and teens in the US, surpassing car accidents in 2020.  According to the new KFF survey, Black adults are more than twice as likely as White adults to have lost a loved one to gun violence and to have personally witnessed someone being shot.

Bank staff were holding their morning meeting in a conference room when the shooter opened fire, Rebecca Buchheit-Sims, the bank manager, said. One bank employee frantically called her husband as she sheltered inside a locked vault, the husband, Caleb Goodlett told CNN affiiliate WLKY. By the time he called 911, police were already aware of the shooting, he said. “Just a very traumatic phone call to get,” Goodlett told the affiliate, adding that he has since seen his wife and she is OK. The gunman, who was still firing when police arrived, was killed in a shootout with officers, police officials said.  Nickolas Wilt, a 26-year-old rookie officer, ran toward the gunfire and was shot in the head, interim Louisville Metro Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. He had graduated from the police academy just 10 days before the shooting. Wilt underwent brain surgery and was in critical but stable condition as of Monday afternoon, the chief said. The gun used in the shooting was an AR-15-style rifle, a federal law enforcement source told CNN. The semi-automatic rifle is the most popular sporting rifle in the US, and 30% of gun owners reported having owned an AR-15 or similar-style rifle, according to the 2021 National Firearms Survey. The AR-15 and its offshoots have been the weapon of choice in many of the most horrific mass shootings in recent memory, including the Covenant school shooting in Nashville just two weeks ago. The bank sits on the fringe of Louisville’s developing downtown business district, state Sen. Gerald Neal, who represents the district where the shooting happened, told CNN.  CNN’s John Miller, Laura Ly, Artemis Moshtaghian, Celina Tebor, Caroll Alvarado, Kristina Sgueglia, Sara Smart and Eric Levenson contributed to this report.\"},{\"1\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"2\":\"April 11, 2023 - The latest on the Louisville bank shooting\",\"3\":\"Louisville police have released bodycam footage showing the tense police confrontation with the gunman who shot multiple people at a bank on Monday, leaving at least five dead.\",\"4\":\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/louisville-kentucky-shooting-04-11-23/index.html\",\"5\":\"2023-04-11T11:29:25Z\",\"6\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"7\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"8\":\"BlogPosting\",\"9\":\"Louisville mayor says friend who died in bank shooting was \\\"the definition of loyalty\\\"\",\"10\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"11\":\"Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg praised his community after a bank shooting Monday that left five people dead.

(At a news conference earlier Monday, police had described the shooter as a 23-year-old male. They amended his age Monday afternoon.) Sturgeon was notified that he was going to be fired, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation, and he wrote a note that indicated that he was going to carry out a shooting at the bank. He was killed by police shortly after opening fire, according to Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the department.\\\\nResponse: Officers arrived at the bank three minutes after the first call of the shooting, Gwinn-Villaroel said, adding that the fast response time saved lives. She said the gunman used a rifle.\\\\nInvestigation: Police did not have \\\"any prior engagement\\\" with the shooter, according to Gwinn-Villaroel. Investigators are working to learn more about him. The gunman live streamed the attack on Instagram, police said. The video was subsequently taken down.\\\\nVictims: Four of the victims who died Monday were identified as Joshua Barrick, 40; Juliana Farmer, 45; Tommy Elliott, 63; and James Tutt, 64, the chief said. Later that evening, police said a fifth victim – 57-year-old Deana Eckert – also died. Several victims remain hospitalized, including a police officer in critical condition after a shootout with the gunman.\\\\nReaction: President Joe Biden condemned the latest mass shooting and called on Congress to act on gun reform.

The shooter's father, James Crumbley, is set to go to trial next month. There have been several other cases in which parents were charged for shootings carried out by their children, though not one in a school mass shooting. For example, the father of the July 4 mass shooter in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, Illinois, was accused of wrongdoing for signing his son’s application for an Illinois Firearm Owners Identification card months after his son displayed concerning behavior. The father, Robert Crimo Jr., ultimately pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless conduct charges and agreed to serve 60 days in jail. In a similar vein, the mother of a 6-year-old boy who shot his teacher at a Virginia school last year faced charges. The boy’s mother ultimately pleaded guilty to a state child neglect charge and felony charges of unlawful use of a controlled substance while possessing a firearm and making a false statement while purchasing a firearm. But, the level of severity in the case of the Crumbleys is different. In a written opinion filed last March, a panel of judges for the state’s appellate court acknowledged the possible precedent-setting nature of these cases but called the situation unique and unusual. Joey Jackson, a CNN legal analyst, said the prosecution’s broad goal in bringing these cases was to deter other parents.\"},{\"1\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"2\":\"Jennifer Crumbley, mother of Oxford school shooter, found guilty\",\"3\":\"Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\",\"4\":\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/oxford-shooting-jennifer-crumbley-trial-verdict/index.html\",\"5\":\"2024-02-06T18:18:23Z\",\"6\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"7\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"8\":\"BlogPosting\",\"9\":\"Jury foreperson said Jennifer Crumbley being the last adult seen with the gun \\\"really hammered it home\\\"\",\"10\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"11\":\"The jury foreperson in the trial of Jennifer Crumbley — the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021 — said the fact that Crumbley was the last adult seen with the gun before the shooting “really hammered it home.”  “Lives hung in the balance, and we took that very seriously,” the woman, who identified herself as the foreperson in the courtroom and who read the jury's verdict, said. She declined to give her name. She said “both sides were well represented” when asked whether the jurors had to convince each other while deliberating.  During her closing arguments, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald put up a photo of Jennifer Crumbley leaving the gun range on November 27, 2021, carrying the gun in a case that her son used in the shooting. “This is the last picture we have of that gun until we see it murder four kids on November 30, and the person holding it is Jennifer Crumbley.

At first, they had been working toward a joint defense, but their cases were separated after their defense learned of a conflict between the two. According to a prosecution filing from last year, Jennifer Crumbley “placed blame” on her husband in the shooting, leading to the split. Why this is important: In bringing manslaughter charges, prosecutors alleged the gunman’s parents are also responsible for the students’ deaths — a novel and unusual legal theory.  Parents have been charged for their child’s actions before, but not in this specific way, according to Misty Marris, a trial attorney who has followed the case.\"},{\"1\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"2\":\"Jennifer Crumbley, mother of Oxford school shooter, found guilty\",\"3\":\"Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\",\"4\":\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/oxford-shooting-jennifer-crumbley-trial-verdict/index.html\",\"5\":\"2024-02-06T18:18:23Z\",\"6\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"7\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"8\":\"BlogPosting\",\"9\":\"Jennifer Crumbley's case looked to expand the scope of blame in shootings.

She pleaded not guilty to all four counts for her role in the November 30, 2021, mass shooting at Oxford High School, which left four students dead and seven other people wounded, including a teacher.  Here's what both sides argued during the trial: The prosecution argued Crumbley was responsible for the deaths because she was “grossly negligent” in giving a gun to her son Ethan, who was 15 at the time, and failing to get him proper mental health treatment despite warning signs. Over a week of testimony, law enforcement officials, school employees, shooting victims and those who knew Jennifer Crumbley testified for the prosecution.  \\\\nThe defense argued the blame laid elsewhere: on her husband for improperly securing the firearm; on the school for failing to notify her about her son’s behavioral issues; and on Ethan himself, who planned and carried out the attack on his own. Defense attorney Shannon Smith said the case was “dangerous” for parents everywhere. During her trial, Jennifer Crumbley took the stand in her own defense and said she wouldn't have done anything differently.\\\\nThe big picture: Broadly, the prosecution’s case relied on an unusual and novel legal strategy and represents an attempt to expand the scope of blame in mass shootings.

Judge Cheryl Matthews decided to tell them yes, and referred the jury to re-read part of her instructions, which says “the prosecutor asserts two different theories to support the charges of Involuntary Manslaughter.” The first theory is that Crumbley committed involuntary manslaughter because she failed to perform a legal duty. The second, is because she was grossly negligent.  \\\"Those theories are two different ways to prove the same crime. Either or both of these theories, if proven, are sufficient to establish the crime of involuntary manslaughter,\\\" the instructions explain. The second question came an hour later: The jury asked if they can infer anything from evidence or witnesses that the prosecution did not bring, specifically not bring in the shooter or other people who could answer how specifically Ethan Crumbley got the gun. Judge Matthews brought the jury in to tell them they can only consider the evidence that was brought in at trial.\"},{\"1\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"2\":\"Jennifer Crumbley, mother of Oxford school shooter, found guilty\",\"3\":\"Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\",\"4\":\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/oxford-shooting-jennifer-crumbley-trial-verdict/index.html\",\"5\":\"2024-02-06T18:18:23Z\",\"6\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"7\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"8\":\"BlogPosting\",\"9\":\"JUST IN: Jury has reached verdict in Jennifer Crumbley manslaughter trial\",\"10\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"11\":\"A jury has reached a verdict in the manslaughter trial of Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021, in a trial that stands as a test of the limits of who’s responsible for a school shooting.  She faces four counts of involuntary manslaughter.

Jennifer Crumbley is on trial for manslaughter in a case that will test the limits of who is responsible for a mass shooting. She pleaded not guilty to four charges of involuntary manslaughter for their alleged roles in her son’s rampage, which left four students dead and seven others wounded. She faces up to 15 years in prison. Her husband, James, is scheduled to go to trial on the same charges in early March. In bringing manslaughter charges, prosecutors alleged the gunman’s parents are also responsible for the students’ deaths – a novel and unusual legal theory. In particular, prosecutors accuse the gunman’s parents of disregarding the risks when they bought a gun for their son four days before the shooting, even though he was struggling with his mental health and contemplating violence. They also say the parents did not mention the gun to school officials in a meeting to discuss Ethan’s disturbing drawings just hours before the fatal shooting.\"},{\"1\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"2\":\"Jennifer Crumbley, mother of Oxford school shooter, found guilty\",\"3\":\"Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\",\"4\":\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/oxford-shooting-jennifer-crumbley-trial-verdict/index.html\",\"5\":\"2024-02-06T18:18:23Z\",\"6\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"7\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"8\":\"BlogPosting\",\"9\":\"Jennifer Crumbley's son has already been sentenced to life in prison without parole for the 2021 shooting\",\"10\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"11\":\"A jury has reached a verdict in the manslaughter trial of Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021.

In that sentencing, Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Kwamé Rowe dismissed last-minute defense pleas that Crumbley’s life is salvageable and noted that the “defendant in his own words” told the court “this is nobody’s fault but his own.” Rowe said victim Justin Shilling, 17, was shot at point-blank range after being told by the defendant to get on his knees. Hana St. Juliana, 14, was shot a second time after she was down, he said, “to finish the job by shooting her again.” “That is an execution. That is torture. He shot most people multiple times. And, as he wrote, he did this for notoriety.

In several messages shown in court Wednesday, Jennifer Crumbley stated how the firearm used in the shooting was stored and secured. On the morning of the shooting, she said she had to go to her son’s school because she was worried he “was going to do something dumb,” Meloche testified. He responded by asking where her firearm was, and Jennifer said the gun was in her vehicle, he testified. However, other testimony has shown that the gun was in Ethan Crumbley’s backpack at school. Meloche also testified that he recalled telling Jennifer Crumbley to call 911 when she realized the gun was missing. He acknowledged that he deleted these and other messages from Facebook.

(At a news conference earlier Monday, police had described the shooter as a 23-year-old male. They amended his age Monday afternoon.) Sturgeon was notified that he was going to be fired, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation, and wrote a note that indicated that he was going to shoot at the bank.

The thing is the president cannot do it alone… there is a legislative process that needs to happen and Congress needs to act.”  The comments came hours after four people were killed in a mass shooting at a Louisville, Kentucky, bank.  Specifically, she added, Biden cannot work without Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage for firearms, require background checks for all gun safeties and eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.  Pressed on whether the president has done all he can, Jean-Pierre said, “We're always going to find and figure out ways that we can take another step outside of all of the historic steps that this president has taken to announce another way to protect communities, but the president has done the work. Now we need Congress to act.”  She said Biden has \\\"done a historic amount of work recently\\\" and pointed to a bipartisan bill he signed into law that year. Jean-Pierre also clarified that the administration is continuing to call on Congress to pass an assault weapons ban, even though that was not mentioned in the president’s recent statement in response to the Louisville shooting.  She said it was “not a shift in strategy at all.

Sturgeon wrote on his LinkedIn profile that he interned at Old National Bank in Louisville for three consecutive summers between 2018 and 2020 before joining as a Commercial Development Professional in June 2021. He became a Syndications Associate and Portfolio Banker at the bank in April 2022, according to the profile. Sturgeon graduated from the University of Alabama in December 2020, according to a spokesperson for the university. He participated in an accelerated master's program, and earned both his bachelor's degree and a master's degree in finance at the same time, the spokesperson, Shane Dorrill, said. Earlier, Sturgeon played basketball and ran track for his high school in a Louisville suburb, and was named a semifinalist for a National Merit Scholarship in 2015, according to local news reports. A former high school classmate of Sturgeon’s who knew him and his family well said he never saw any “sort of red flag or signal that this could ever happen.” In a 2018 college essay posted to the website CourseHero, a user identified as a University of Alabama student named Connor Sturgeon wrote that he had had trouble fitting in at school. “My self-esteem has long been a problem for me,” the essay read. “As a late bloomer in middle and high school, I struggled to a certain extent to fit in, and this has given me a somewhat negative self-image that persists today. Making friends has never been especially easy, so I have more experience than most in operating alone.” The author wrote that in college, he had “begun to mature socially and am beginning to see improvement in this area,” and that he hoped to “be more self-aware and start becoming a ‘better’ person.” Sturgeon's father, Todd Sturgeon, was head coach of the men’s basketball team at the University of Indianapolis for 10 years and later coached basketball and taught US history at his son’s high school, according to news reports and his LinkedIn profile. A 2007 story published by Todd Sturgeon’s alma mater, DePauw University, quoted an Indianapolis Star article about his retirement from the University of Indianapolis that year, in which he said that watching his son Connor had inspired him to step down from the team. “Todd Sturgeon said he was watching his son, Connor, at a basketball camp recently when he had a realization: Maybe he'd rather have more time to spend with his own sons than other people's,” the article said.\"},{\"1\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"2\":\"April 10, 2023: Louisville, Kentucky shooting\",\"3\":\"At least five people were killed in a mass shooting Monday at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky, police said.\",\"4\":\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/louisville-kentucky-shooting-04-10-23/index.html\",\"5\":\"2023-04-10T13:57:09Z\",\"6\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"7\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"8\":\"BlogPosting\",\"9\":\"Kentucky governor orders all flags to half-staff to honor victims of Louisville shooting\",\"10\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"11\":\"All state flags throughout Kentucky have been ordered to fly at half-staff until Friday evening to honor the victims of the Louisville bank shooting, Gov.

It’s a largely working-class community, with a median household income of about $48,000 and in which about 16% of the population lives in poverty, according to the US Census. Maine Gov. Janet Mills governor, who met her husband in Lewiston, described it as a “special place.” President Joe Biden has spoken by phone with Maine lawmakers and “offered full federal support in the wake of this horrific attack,” the White House said in a statement. Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline is “heartbroken for our city and our people,” he said. “Lewiston is known for our strength and grit and we will need both in the days to come.” Lewiston Auburn Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce President Shanna Cox on Thursday called the scene of both attacks “family locations.” “It was family league activity at the bowling alley. The likeliness of this having direct impact for so many here is so real.” Auburn Mayor Jason Levesque lost friends in the shooting, he told “CNN This Morning.” A teenager who went to school with his son was shot and is expected to recover, he said. “There’s going to be very few people in this community that have not been touched by this,” he said. “It’s going to be with me for the rest of my life, and it’s really hard for me to explain that.” “The other folks that I knew that were there either as witnesses or family members of witnesses; it’s obviously traumatic,” Levesque said. “The bright spot was seeing individuals reunified with their loved ones after not knowing for so long, but on the on the other side, the ones that were waiting and waiting, probably would never be reunified.”\"},{\"1\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"2\":\"October 25, 2023 - Lewiston, Maine mass shootings\",\"3\":\"A manhunt is underway after a shooting rampage occurred in Lewiston, Maine, on Wednesday night, according to multiple law enforcement sources.

MacFarlane grew up in the Greater Portland Maine area but had only recently moved back to the state, his sister told CNN.  According to Brooks, her brother was one of the first deaf people in the state of Vermont to get his commercial trucking driver's license.   “Many states don’t let deaf drive trucks so I’m very proud of him for achieving that. He worked as a truck driver for several years,” Brooks said.  MacFarlane also loved riding his motorcycle and hanging out with his dog named M&M, Brooks added.

This is not who he is,” O’Neill said. “He is not someone who has had mental health issues for his lifetime or anything like that.”   The 40-year-old Card is a petroleum supply specialist in the Army Reserve and first enlisted in 2002, according to records provided by the Army on Thursday. He has no combat deployments, according to the records.   Clifford Steeves of Massachusetts told CNN he knew Card when they served in the Army Reserve together, starting in the early 2000s until about a decade ago. He said he never witnessed any concerning behavior from Card.  “He was a very nice guy — very quiet. He never overused his authority or was mean or rude to other soldiers,” Steeves said. “It’s really upsetting.”  Steeves said the two served together around the country at different points, including in Wisconsin, Georgia and New York. He said he felt as though he “grew up” with Card because they entered the Army as young men and trained together.   Steeves said that while “aggressive leadership was very prominent” in the Army, Card stuck out for being a “rational, understanding person” who “led through respect rather than fear.”  Steeves said Card never saw combat but had extensive training, including firearms training and land navigation, “so he would be very comfortable in the woods.” He described Card as an “outdoors type of guy” and a skilled marksman who was one of the best shooters in his unit.  Another former Army Reserve member who served with Card also described him as a “nice guy” who “never had an issue with anybody.” The servicemember, who asked to speak anonymously due to the sensitivity of the situation, did not recall Card showing any kind of violent behavior.\"},{\"1\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"2\":\"October 25, 2023 - Lewiston, Maine mass shootings\",\"3\":\"A manhunt is underway after a shooting rampage occurred in Lewiston, Maine, on Wednesday night, according to multiple law enforcement sources.

The nonprofit and CNN define mass shootings as those in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter. Nearly 1 in 5 US adults have had a family member killed by a gun, including homicides and suicides, according to a 2023 survey from KFF (formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation). About the same proportion of adults have been personally threatened with a gun, and about 1 in 6 adults has witnessed an injury from a shooting, the survey found. More background: The FBI defines “mass murder” as the murder of four or more people and tracks “active shooter incidents,” but there is no federal or agreed-upon definition for a mass shooting. For all its data background, the Gun Violence Archive’s work is, at its heart, basic journalism. Researchers scrape data automatically from about 7,500 law enforcement agencies, media outlets and more organizations, the executive director Mark Bryant told CNN in 2022. They then comb through the results, double-check media sources, follow up with police, and add that information to the database. Most shootings are added to the system within about 72 hours, Bryant said. CNN's Annette Choi, Eric Levenson and Curt Merrill contributed reporting to this report.\"},{\"1\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"2\":\"October 25, 2023 - Lewiston, Maine mass shootings\",\"3\":\"A manhunt is underway after a shooting rampage occurred in Lewiston, Maine, on Wednesday night, according to multiple law enforcement sources.

Here's what we know so far: More than a dozen victims: At least eight people were killed and seven more were wounded in the massacre, local officials said. Victims ranged in age from 5 to 61 years old, according to a Dallas-area medical group. A father who rushed to be with his son at the mall described the horror that awaited him there.\\\\nPolice killed the gunman: An officer was already at the mall for an unrelated call when the gunfire broke out, the Allen police chief said Saturday. The officer followed the sound of gunshots, tracked down the shooter and killed him, according to the chief.\\\\nThe shooter's background: The gunman, who dressed in tactical gear, has been identified as 33-year-old Mauricio Garcia, a senior law enforcement source told CNN. Garcia had been living in some kind of temporary housing in the Dallas area, the source said. He used to work as a security guard and had received firearms training in that role, according to an official database.\\\\nThe gunman's weapons: The shooter was armed with an AR-15 style rifle and had at least one other weapon on him when he was gunned down by police, a senior law enforcement source told CNN. Police also found multiple weapons in his car.\\\\nPotential extremist ties: Authorities are investigating whether the shooter was motivated by right-wing extremism, a senior law enforcement source said. Authorities have not zeroed in on a specific motive, but the source said the shooter was found with an insignia on his clothing that read \\\"RWDS\\\" — an acronym known to watch groups — potentially standing for \\\"Right Wing Death Squad.\\\" He also had an extensive social media presence that included neo-Nazi and White supremacist-related posts, according to the official.\\\\nWhat we're still waiting for: More word directly from Texas officials. Authorities did not hold an official news conference Sunday, and have released little information about their investigation.

A veteran and former police officer described the haunting scenes he found when he arrived at the outlet mall in Allen, Texas, Saturday. The aftermath of the mass shooting there was “horrific,” Steven Spainhouer told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield on Sunday. The former Army officer said he wouldn’t wish it upon anyone to see or experience what he did. Spainhouer said he was planning to meet his son, who works at the H&M store at the outlet mall, for lunch. His son called to tell him about the active shooter and that he was sheltered in the break room at the store. Spainhouer drove to the outlet mall and said when he showed up, he saw many people fleeing the scene and counted seven bodies on the ground. He rushed up to different victims to check for a pulse, and said he witnessed one woman who had “nothing left of her face or head, it was gone.” Spainhouer performed chest compressions on another victim, who coughed up blood and then died, he told CNN. Then he saw a young child who crawled out from underneath one of the victims and was “caked with blood from head to toe,” Spainhouer said. The child kept saying that his mother was hurt. The father, who has personal and professional experience handling firearms, said the horror he found at the mall will repeat itself if lawmakers don't limit the access of certain weapons to the public. Spainhouer added that both he and his son will receive counseling for what they witnessed Saturday. Allen police subsequently disputed parts of Spainhouer's account, noting \\\"inconsistencies\\\" between his media interviews and the facts of the investigation. The department said it conducted a follow-up interview with Spainhouer and \\\"determined that [he] is not a credible incident witness.\\\" According to the police department, Spainhouer did not perform CPR, and did not move a deceased mother who was covering a child who survived the shooting. In response, Spainhouer stood by his account, said he was \\\"hurt and disappointed,\\\" and clarified that \\\"a small child pulled himself from under a victim and I assisted him to a safe space away from the area.\\\" This article was updated on May 16 to reflect the Allen Police Department's statement disputing parts of Steven Spainhouer's eyewitness account — and Spainhouer's response to the police press release.\"},{\"1\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"2\":\"Live updates: Allen, Texas, shooting at outlet mall leaves at least 8 dead\",\"3\":\"Eight people were killed and at least seven others wounded when a gunman opened fire at an Allen, Texas, outlet mall Saturday afternoon.

Garcia was approved to work as a commissioned security guard in Texas from April 2016 until April 2020, when his license expired, according to the Texas Online Private Security database, maintained by the Texas Department of Public Safety. His profile shows he worked for at least three security companies. None of those companies immediately responded to requests for comment.  According to the database, Garcia received Level II  and Level III security training. The former covers security laws in Texas; the latter, which is required for all commissioned security officers in Texas, includes firearm training and the demonstration of firearm proficiency, according to Jonah Nathan, vice president of Ranger Guard, a security guard service in Texas not affiliated with Garcia’s employers. In 2018, Garcia also completed a separate firearms proficiency training course, which requires six hours of continuing education, according to the Texas DPS database.  Private security guards in Texas undergo background checks and are disqualified if they have committed certain crimes, such as assault, burglary or sexual offenses, among others, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety website and state codes. They are also disqualified if they have been dishonorably discharged from the US military; have been found incompetent by a court of law; or have been required to register as a sex offender. It’s unclear why Garcia’s license expired. A police officer killed the gunman outside the outlet mall after he carried out the massacre Saturday, according to the Allen police chief.

Cuellar added that strict gun control measures have not ended mass shootings in blue states around the country, arguing more needs to be done to get to the root of the issue.  Some context: The attack in Allen, Texas, is one of at least 199 mass shootings in the US this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. The archive, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people have been wounded or killed, excluding a gunman. Texas has loosened restrictions on gun ownership in recent years amid several high-profile mass shootings that have devastated its communities. In 2021, legislation went into effect allowing most Texans who legally own a firearm to carry it openly in public without obtaining a permit or training. A 2022 study found that states with weaker gun laws have higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides and suicides. Correction: An earlier version of this post misidentified Rep. Henry Cuellar's political party. He is a Democrat.\"},{\"1\":\"<df[,2] [520 × 2]>\",\"2\":\"Live updates: Allen, Texas, shooting at outlet mall leaves at least 8 dead\",\"3\":\"Eight people were killed and at least seven others wounded when a gunman opened fire at an Allen, Texas, outlet mall Saturday afternoon.

Events with significantly lower mis-attribution of articles/headlines they are: The Farmington New Mexico shooting, the judgment against Jennifer Crumbley and the Prague university shooting.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe uniqueness of these three events is understandable; the shooting in Farmington was unique in the age of its victims (73-97) and the method of its perpetrator, the case against Jenifer Crumbley was poised to set a precedent in the USA (by now it has set it already) and the shooting in Prague has shown the danger of exporting the motivations and conditions of mass shooting from the USA into other countries with similar cultural contexts.\n",
