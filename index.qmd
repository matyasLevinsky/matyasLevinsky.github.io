## What did I upload?

#### February 2024

#### Testing in March, do not upload

With these options set, footnotes^[This is footnote testing.] and citations^[See Levinsky et. al, 2029] will (respectively) be automatically be placed in the margin of the document rather than the bottom of the page. As an example, when I cite Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund (2018), the citation bibliography entry itself will now appear in the margin.
